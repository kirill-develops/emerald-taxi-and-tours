Rooms are beautiful and views are breathtaking We stayed at Breathless and we thought the nightlife would be a bit better, but there wasn’t a ton of people. The staff is TOP notch. Alberto and Craig were our butlers and they were they were beyond kind and available for anything we needed. They jumped in to help me coordinate my husbands birthday surprise and it went off with no issues. Jamila on the rooftop is so hospitable and warm. So is Jordan the lifeguard. Will definitely return and recommend to others. Also, try the jerk chicken truck at secrets. Lol ",

                  "text": "I am going to be as honest as I can. To put it bluntly,.this is a HOTEL with all-inclusive benefits of the sister property. You pretty much have to go to Secrets to enjoy certain things.  Breathless has a younger vibe. \nUpon arrival the staff was very friendly and welcoming. The lobby was nice and the pool area is BEAUTIFUL. The rooms were nice BUT not the cleanest when we arrived. The bed was very loud just sitting on it and the couch looked as though it was damaged slightly based on the legs. \nWe had a good view of the pool. The main issue I had was we had to walk to the beach via Secrets Resort. The restaurants not being accessible was also a problem. They opened for breakfast , lunch and dinner literally.  Not all were open at the same time, so if you wanted something specific then you had to make sure you went to that place at a certain time. I am accustomed to being able to access food at all times at an all-inclusive.  Imagine being at the pool and you get hungry. Your thought is oh let me run to the little restaurant next to the pool. The only problem is, they won't let you in because you have swim attire on and you may be a little wet. You can't come in. They'll suggest you go change, come back down, eat, then go back and put your clothes on again to swim. They'll even say room service is an option.  Which if everyone is ordering all at once...how long will that take...I'll tell you 1 whole hour. That was a problem for just about everyone at the resort. \nMy thoughts for someone visiting, just be ready to walk a bit, small portions of food (good but small), some not so nice staff in certain places(borderline rude) and boring entertainment(good idea..wrong resort). The DJ'd parties were cool but the other entertainment was something that should have taken place during the daytime. Hope this helps someone.",

               "description": "A destination in itself, set on 400 acres of manicured grounds with two miles of beachfront. We offer three distinctive resort experiences - Founders Cove, Rose Hall Villas and Eclipse, most of which have views of the Caribbean Sea. All of our guests can enjoy the extensive facilities of this destination, which include Fern Tree, A Salamander Spa, an award-winning spa oasis in Jamaica, an 18-hole par-72 championship golf course, our own equestrian centre with 28 horses, the Sugar Mill, awarded as Jamaica's best restaurant and Delmare, the highly-desired seafood culinary experience. As a discerning traveller, you will enjoy the luxury of space and tranquility we have to offer. Imagine your first morning taking in the panoramic view of the horizon, and watching the sunrise having just concluded yoga meditation in our overwater bungalow. Whether you choose to lounge on the beach, play a round tennis or golf, visit a local art gallery, or go horse riding along the beach, your days at Half Moon are yours to spend in any way you wish.",

Since I am a Hilton Honors Diamond member I decided that I could not go wrong with a Hilton Resort. I booked through a travel agent and the experience was amazing.  Preston, one of the bellmen greeted my team with a tremendous smile and immediately assumed our luggage. The front desk check in for the Diamond desk took a little while, but once it was my time to check in the experience was great. The Hotel Manager Carl was very engaging. He understands his assignment and has this property in tip-top shape. The Main dining hall is probably one of the best in the world. The cuisine is high quality and the serving staff is second to non. Shout out to Sonie, Malik and LaTisha who all serve in the man dining room.  The rooms were comfortable and the housekeeping staff provided excellent service. The staff in the coffee shop was excellent. I will be back to stay at The Hilton Rose Hall in the near future!",

                  "text": "The service by far was the highlight of our vacation.  Everyone was polite and welcoming throughout our entire stay.  Colleen at Mangoes was an absolute sweetheart.  We had an Oceanfront room which was very clean but was in definite need of an upgrade.  The rooms are small but was sufficient enough for our family of 3.  Wifi was pretty decent throughout the resort.  Making dinner reservations at all the restaurants was easy and they were able to seat us right away at each restaurant.  The only restaurant that we did not try was Three Palms.  The food at each restaurant was great.  Our least favorite was the Rum Factory which was our first night.  I heard in past reviews to try Moonstone for breakfast but unfortunately the entire week we were there, the buffet (Fresh) was our only option.  Moonstone was not open for breakfast.  The pools were nice.  We brought our own pool floats as the ones in the lazy river were hard to come by.  My 16 year old son was able to snag one each time we were there so he could go on the slides but there was never a time that all 3 of us would be able to have one at the same time.  Entertainment was great.  Yes, there is A LOT of seaweed on the beach but the staff try their very best to keep it clean daily.  I was very disappointed at how murky the water was.  It was not clear whatsoever but the temperature of the water was great.  We had no issues getting a lounger by the pools or beach.  You may have an issue finding one in the shade but we didn't mind because we were in the water the majority of the time.  We did not wake up at 3am to put our towel down, there were always chairs available.  Drinks were fantastic!  All in all we had a great time and I would definitely recommend.",

Vanessa (Hotel Main Restaurant),Preston ( Hotel Bellman), Leo ( Chef at Charcoal Grill), Chef Ron\n(Morning Sous Chef) did a great job by making us feel welcome and had Great conversation with all of them.\nThe Food at the resort was excellent. lots of variety, different venues and cuisine. \n\nThe Three Palms Restaurant was our only disappointment. Service and food good but we were outside and had 2 wild cats sit by our table and a lot of flies. We were directed outside and should have asked to move inside.\nThe restaurant needs a facelift. (Paint, New signage, lighting inside.) The extra fee for the restaurant was minimal but the experience was not as good as the Hotel.\n\nWe were there for a wedding which had to be moved inside.  The rehearsal dinner and the wedding reception was nice. The staff had to move the ceremony inside due to rain. The staff did react well to the change and moved inside.\n\nWe had an HVAC leak in our room.  The maintenance team was prompt, courteous and apologetic. They fixed the problem in less than 30 minutes.\n\nWe played golf and rented a Cabana. Both were enjoyable.\n\n",

Have to say the cooks really work hard here. Male staff  friendly, nice and accommodating.\nFemale staff were so rude and unfriendly mostly the younger ones..This was my first time in Jamaica while food and country it self is beautiful. My experience with the people made me not want to return. Which is sad considering I was so excited to finally go to Jamaica. Glad to be back in my home. Will start to explore my own country rather then go to a third world country where some of the people seem to not care about their jobs or proper customer service especially when their prices are ridiculously high whether it be the resort or off the resort. Couldn't even do excursions because it would cost me an additional $500.00 US. They just  rip off tourists and say \"oh its Covid\" that caused the price to sky rocket. I shouldn't be paying more for things in a third world country then i do in North America. The Quiznos at the airport charged me 42.00 for 2 subs with 1 slice of deli meat on each sub. Jamaica is TEEF!. This is my honest opinion of Jamaica and the Holiday Inn.",

Oh I haven't mentioned  the worst---  The FLIES - \n\nOnly thing good about this place is the beach. Nothing else.\n\nHave travelled to several Caribbean islands and so far worst I have seen and experience.  Never have I heard or seen so many people complaining about a hotel service. Front desk was swamped with many people wanting to speak to a manager or having many issues.  \n\nWe will be going back to Jamaica - Jamaica deserves a second chance- Just not to this place. ",

The only place I recommend when staying in Montego Bay delivering high value and a range of services on site. Was my 5th stay at the hotel with my very first being in 1998! Has since been the location of many special moments and nice to see familiar faces there. Was pleased to see the general manager was promoted from within they’ve always been very good to me on my stays in the past. I didn’t get a chance to say hello this time round but with them leading the team your in good hands. Very family friendly and the staff are all great if you remember to also treat them with respect and that they’re human they will do the most they can to help you enjoy your stay. The rooms do vary but if you’re looking for an authentic Jamaica experience rather than a butler-like service which isn’t for me then look no further. Great mix of visitors stay here from all over the world many travelled from England, UK like us and Jamaican people also vacation there, which you don’t get in many other hotels. Different areas of the private beach and activities to keep you going on site plus great connections for trips outside the hotel. Big thanks again to all the Holiday Inn, Montego Bay team we hope to see you again soon! ",

We were first told I only reserved for two adults and had to show that I reserved for 2 adults two children. We reserved a double bed room and received a king bed with a pull out couch that would not open. Maintenance and housekeeping tried with 4 people and still could not open. Eventually we were given a cot for my son to sleep on. We had jo extra pillows for him. We called housekeeping twice and no one delivered pillows for us, my husband had to go downstairs to get one for him. We were told “if that was one available”. We went to look for the “game room” that’s in the picture here on the website and we’re told it closed during covid. The buffet food was disgusting. \n\nPositives- the entertainment was good, they really got everyone involved and the managers cocktail was so much fun!!!! \n\nI don’t think we stay here again.",

Went out, came back key didn’t work, back to the front desk,  today we have been locked out the majority of the day,  finally a maintenance man came & did what he could.

                  "text": "My wife, 7-year-old daughter and I stayed at the Hyatt Ziva Rose Hall for four nights in June 2023. We took the hotel's shuttle to and from the airport for a reasonable cost. The trip is short -- probably 10 to 15 minutes. From the bell stand onward, I thought the service was excellent.\n\nThe front desk staff thoroughly explained the resort and amenities to us, and we were offered a cold drink at this time. The room was ready and was very clean. The resort property is a bit older, but it seems well-maintained. The doors appeared to be freshly painted, and the decor and furniture were recent. The room temperature was comfortable. The housekeeping service did a very good job and thoroughly cleaned our room every day.\n\nWe started our day with breakfast at Choicez, and we enjoyed the selection and quality of the food available. The servers were friendly and warm. We then made our way to the beach. Keep in mind that the beach here is fairly small, and there are fewer shaded spots to sit in than I would prefer. But the good news is that you can let your kids play in the water without worrying much about them. The water is shallow and the entire beach is protected. \n\nWe frequently ordered drinks from servers on the beach and had jerk chicken for lunch. The service and quality were very good and in line with what we've had at other nice all-inclusive resorts.\n\nOur afternoons were spent at the pool, and we enjoyed that space as well. The swim-up bar had a nice variety of drinks and the bartenders were attentive. Although we stayed on the family side of the resort, I did note a fair number of young adults in the pool without families, but we didn't have any issues or problems.\n\nWe would then head back to the room and get cleaned up for dinner. We enjoyed the dinner options but thought that Petit Pariz was the best. Even with a child in tow, the experience was wonderful. Our server was top-notch and the food was excellent. I recommend contacting the resort in advance so that you can make dining reservations before you get there; we didn't do this and our options were somewhat limited.\n\nAfter dinner, we enjoyed the shows. They aren't anything remarkable, but we enjoyed sitting outside, having a drink, and watching an interesting performance. It was a nice way to end the day. \n\nWe have been to about 5 all-inclusive resorts over the years, and we really enjoyed Hyatt Ziva Rose Hall, largely because of the excellent service and friendly people. Enjoy your vacation!",

                  "text": "Im giving this hotel 2 stars instead of 1 because the bed was comfortable and the AC was working well- otherwise this would be a 1 star review. \nThis resort needs work. The staff have bad attitudes and the food is mostly not good. Save your time at the restaurants, the best food is at the buffet- so basically you’re eating buffet/cafeteria style if you want decent food. From check-in to check-out, there is a lack of information and poor/flat attitudes from the staff. \nThe floor in my room was filthy- I walked across the floor once and my feet were black. I mostly had “do not disturb” on my door because I heard there were recent robberies in rooms- and I was staying in my room alone. The day I put the sign to “please come in” for housekeeping- I came back later and the staff had turned my sign over back to “do not disturb” and never entered the room. My mini bar was not restocked. Everything you want at this hotel, you have to ask for, and may get blatantly ignored. I asked for water service in the cafeteria- was ignored by 2 different servers. Outside at the grill- I asked 2-3 employees for a fork- just was ignored or when I was looked at- it was a with a flat dead-eyed stare and literally the walked away from me.  So expect to eat hot food  with your hands if you’re into that kind of thing. When I went to get a towel, was ignored by staff member when I had a question…. it just goes on and on. The general vibe I got from the staff is that they hated their jobs and the guests. I feel like I paid for a 4day vacation to be treated poorly. I would not eat this food or tolerate this service at home- I would just leave. Unfortunately that wasnt an option, as I was in another country- and I was spending time with family members trying to make the best of it. \nAdditionally, the pool area although nice to look at, was not clean. The water had chunks of mildew and random debris floating in it- making it kind of gross to go into the pool by early afternoon when it got crowded. \n\nOverall, I left this resort feeling like I had wasted my time and money. I was disappointed the entire time, and I was happy to leave. Save your money.",

                  "text": "Stayed here with family to visit Glistening Waters (20 minutes away) enroute to Negril.\nThe hotel reception & bar area look very nice and the view on the from the balcony at night with the pool lights on looks stunning.\nCheck-in seemed to take longer than was necessary and room was ready at 3pm, standard check-in time.\nStaff in reception and security were all lovely.\nThe room was about a five minute walk away towards the pool area.\nI don't recall the room number but we could see the pier and restaurant (to the side) from our balcony. We hadn't booked a Seaview but could actually see the sea!\nThe room was damp and unfortunately the damp smell remained for the duration of our stay.\nSome of the sign posts for room numbers are incorrect and can send you on a wild goose chase. I've never seen this before in a hotel!\nIf you want water, there are filling stations in various points of the hotel. Luckily, ours was really close to the room. There is no bottled water in the bars.\nWe heard an alarm going off somewhere down the corridor from our room a number of times over the stay. It sounded like a fire alarm but no one evacuated that we could see! This happened at various times including at night but luckily didn't wake our children.\nThe food in the main restaurant was fairly good although there were some items were overcooked. I tried a hash brown one day and it was like a piece of wood. They appeared overcooked most days and so I didn't bother with them again. The staff in the restaurant were all really nice and very helpful.\nThe pool area looked nice but we spent the majority of the time on the beach which was lovely.\nThere is a kids kids club which our children enjoyed and a kids pool with slides and water firing out all over the place. Again, the kids enjoyed it. Some of the features in the pool though are really unsafe. There are fibreglass (I think) animals which were broken and in the areas they are broken, the material is sharp. If you caught yourself on one of the jagged areas you would probably cut yourself, so be careful. They are beneath water so difficult to spot.\nThere was nothing disastrous about our stay, but there are a number of things that the hotel should address and fix.\nI don't think I'd stay here again.\n",

The guest at the hotel were great . We had a few issues at the pool bar . Every time we would order a drink he made sure we waited and rolled his eyes every time. There was a Concierge the was a real B @#$ch. we have dealt with rude people before but lord this was bad . We are trying to book dinners and services just like the gentleman at the pool bar didn’t want us to be there. We have never felt like we weren’t welcome to Jamaica before till this trip . We absolutely did not feel the “One Love “ vibe there this week . The resort sent us to a “shopping area” controlled by them and had a rude guest service there as well . We were not diverse enough in black culture she stated. In the other locations away from the resort people were just how we remembered them great friendly people . Our friends that traveled with us this was their 1st Jamaica experience and they are not happy as well killing 3 roaches in the room they had. We will second guess going back to spend our hard earned money in a place that has people treating you like you just don’t belong. With that said this being a lower budget resort I guess you get what you pay for .",

Give her a promotion and a raise!\nOur Butlers with a capital B....because they were great. Neo*-( full name Neonlayne) went above and beyond and kept the surprises coming. He made us feel like we were his only customers. Paul also provided great service. BTW- I love the Butler Service whatsapp group- genius! \nSanjae at the bars- all of them- kept us entertained and was on point with the drinks.\nRakeal (I feel like I am spelling this wrong), has only been here for a month, but you could have sworn she has been here forever! Keep her!\nAndrew Hall- wonderful personality! \nOur grill master from the Jerk hut! Quiet and kind.\nTotal of 5 stars for the overall service!\nLandscaping is beautiful! \nFood at the buffet was better than expected. Steakhouse is the best!\n\nNow to the working conditions for the staff. Who is HR for this group of hotels?? C'mon. Give these people two days off. How do you expect them to have a personal life, take care of kids, family, homes with 1 day off! Even if it's not two consecutive days. You can do better Playa Hotels and Resorts.... up your game. Without people you can't do the work and make the profits. Thumbs down on this! \n\nRooms: Building 'A' needs a total overhaul! Rooms are very spacious, but very dated, needs a lot of renovations and new furniture. \nThe hallways to the rooms have broken doors, hanging off hinges, dirty furniture. Elevators need repairs. Certainly not 5 star. Was very disappointed- this is not a cheap hotel! But I swore I was walking into a 2.5 star venue when going down the hallway to my room.\n\nBuilding C: cleaner hallways and rooms. Oceanfront room was great. \n\nMoonstone restaurant- needs a good reno as well. Rusty chairs, door to the kitchen needs a coat of white paint. Simple things to make this the 5 star hotel that it claims to be.\n\nOverall very accommodating for families with kids, excellent service, nice beach, good food and outstanding service! I probably won't pay this much again at this hotel until some upgrades are done. Giving 5 stars for service and landscaping combined. Food as well.\n3 stars for room in building A, and 4 for room in Building C - We had a room change from ocean view to ocean front! So much better!\n\nI took photos of the broken doors, and dirty hallways in building A, but not posting as I don't think it's indicative of all the buildings. \n\n",

                  "text": "My family of 5 spent a week at Jewel Grande and wanted to give my honest feedback. Kids are 16, 14 and 11.\n\nBeach: I will start by saying, I am very accustom to super clear water where you can see see your feet when standing. With that said, you can’t here and this was not due to weather. We had no rain the whole trip and weather was impeccable! The water is murky in their bay. They have seaweed, but clear a patch of area to go out to the water which is nice, so no worries there. I just wasn’t a fan of the beach here at all. My last stay in Jamaica our hotel had crystal clear water with floats anchored to the ocean floor. We spent everyday there, which due to the murky water we didn’t spend any time here. The Hobie cats are awesome! Also, chairs are more than plentiful at the beach. I don’t see the need for a cabana. Plenty of palm trees creating shade.\nPool: The pools have beautiful views, however being a pool owner myself, I did notice the cleanliness of the pool could be better. When we went to the pool, we always found a chair. To get a good chair or several together, be there by 11.\nFood: We found the food to be overall pretty bland. We are Texans, so we are use to lots of flavors. We did enjoy the breakfast buffet, the hibachi was good (and table service at pier side was good too!), we also enjoyed the Italian restaurant. Waves, the steakhouse and Mexican restaurant was flavorless in our opinion. Tip on reservations- I noticed you can really get in anywhere you want at any time except hibachi because there’s only 2 hibachi tables. We never went to eat at the time our butler made the reservation and never had trouble getting seated immediately.\nVilla: We felt it wasn’t worth the money but did accommodate our family size nicely which is why we chose it. It comes with a butler, we had Ronald and Garçon who were amazing!!! With that said, we didn’t really use them much. We did 2 private excursions and they packed us a cooler of drinks to put in the car which was so nice as well as left us snacks at the villa. We didn’t use to plunge pool, it was dirty and maintenance never cleaned it (called twice), but likely wouldn’t have used it even if it was clean. The villa has lots of stairs. Master is on 3rd floor for the views, but lots of climbing to get there. Also, the decor is pretty dated, but we knew that by the pictures.\nExcursions: We did 2 private excursions which I felt was definitely worth the money! $300 for the day for a van. 1 day we went to Negril. We stopped in Lucea, the capital of Hanover and ate some local cuisine with our amazing driver. When we got to Negril we went shopping, then spent some time on seven mile beach, which has the most beautiful water! We headed over to Ricks Cafe, ate and did cliff jumping. This is the place to view sunsets! 2nd excursion was to Ocho Rios. We went to Dunns River Falls, which was amazing!l We then headed to Blue Hole which was so breathtaking, the kids jumped the waterfalls. We also went on a snorkeling catarman cruise another day, which the kids loved! You get to stop at Jimmy Buffets where they have water toys and you can eat.\nSpa: we enjoyed ourselves and the amenities that come with it.\nAirport: we didn’t do Club Mobay and I don’t regret saving that money!! Arriving, we got through customs in about 25-30 minutes. We booked transportation directly through hotel. So easy! We were in the van within 5 minutes of giving our name. Departure, the security line looks absolutely insane at the airport in Jamaica but moves so fast, took us 40 mins to get through with time to eat on the other side of security.\n\nThe staff at the Jewel is amazing and want to make your stay nice! We definitely enjoyed our week at the Jewel, I’m just not sure I’d book this hotel again due to the beach and food. I’d give it 3.5 out of 5 stars.",

                  "text": "I just returned from a one week vacation at this resort with my family of 5. My overall experience was good. I received a surprising upgrade which was greatly appreciated. \n\nThe room was nice, but could use a good clean. The countertops, tub, shower and floors looked like they hadn't been scrubbed (only surface cleaned) in quite some time. The cushions on balcony chairs have seen better days. They were covered in stains and cigarette burns. Housekeeping will make beds and supply towels (sometimes) only. One day they didn't come until 6pm and asked me \"what do you want me to do?\" They should know their job. \n\nOur stay came with a butler service. They made dinner reservations and would book excursions. I did ask about a fishing excursion on day 2 and never heard back after he told me he would look into it. They were both very friendly, providing us info on daily activities and nightly entertainment and checking in with us. \n\nThe pools were kept tidy and clean, but the jacuzzis were not working the entire week. I didn't have any trouble finding chairs with shade by the pool if I saved them before 10am. The beach is nice, but has alot of seaweed that staff were constantly raking up. There are areas of seaweed in the swimming area. My daughter got stung by a jellyfish swimming through it. But there are a few clear areas with soft sand to swim and sit in. Although, the water always looks murky. The cabanas were nice and clean. The cabana concierge service was fantastic getting drinks and lunch for guests.\n\nThe food was JAMAIZING! I didn't have one bad meal. There's something for everyone and a quite a few restaurants to choose from (Italian, International, Steak house, Jamaican, Japanese). \n\nI had a wonderful time, but I most likely won't return. I would prefer a place with a larger beach, less seaweed and clearer water. ",

At first we were disappointed in the room they gave us facing a wall and the room smelled so bad of weed, I know it’s Jamaica and we are cool with weed but we did not want to sleep in that smell but we did for 1 night and they next day the manager changed us to the room we always stay in. The food of course is amazing, the service and workers are so friendly and always welcoming and saying welcome home! A huge thank you to Johneve at front desk, Hugh and Abraham bell boys, Jemar at the buffet for breakfast and lunch and my special friend Ronaldo who is  a waiter at the beach and pool.  House cleaning was fantastic , always asking if we needed anything . We will return for our 10th visit!  One Love!",

The food was first class with a good selection at all sittings. \nThe only thing stopping me giving this place full marks is the beach. It is relatively small compared to the 2 other hotels and the sand is man made which is very uncomfortable on your feet. The sea is not as impressive as I’m used to and is full of weed…It also felt as if you were walking in mud a short distance out.\nOverall an awesome holiday blessed with awesome weather.\nJust a shame for me, the overall experience was let down by the beach…Yeah Man 😉",

                  "text": "Round Hill is a completely unique place in Jamaica and perhaps in the world - the only place I know of where you have the cozy ambience of a small resort with the amenities of a large resort. That said, it's expensive. It was expensive when we were there six years ago and it's even more expensive now. It's true that the rooms (in the Pineapple House which is the hotel section) are not as luxurious as some you might stay in for the price, you are paying for the service, the quality of the food, the magical beauty of the place. \n\nIn my last review back in 2017 I complained about the coffee, but that's been completely resolved with a French Press and Blue Mountain coffee. \n\nMiscellaneous tips:\n\nThe breakfast situation is still a little confusing if you don't know, and it's not always explained well. There are two levels of buffets: Continental which includes smoked fish, bagels, fruit, cereals, pastries; and the complete buffet with hot Jamaican dishes. When you get the buffet you can also order off the menu. \n\nAn 18% are included in the bill for the meal, and those tips and anything you add are pooled among the staff. If you want your server to receive something extra you need to give it to them in cash. \n\nThe frozen sorrel margarita is the best thing on the drink menu. I had one every day. \n\nRooms in the Pineapple House have the best beach and pool access. The lower numbers will be closer to the pool and be noisier, if you want a quieter room ask for one farther from the pool. \n\nThe dining at dinner off the menu was really spectacular. One day a week there is a beach buffet which was not that great but the rest of the meals made up for it. \n\nLast but not least, the gym is very well equipped and has a beautiful view of the sea. \n\nI think that's it. If you're on the fence, just go. You'll be glad you did.",

               "description": "Warm turquoise beaches, fusion flavors and reggae sounds will make your senses vibrate at this famous bay located on the northwest area of Jamaica; the same bay that was conquered by the greatest conquistador, Christopher Columbus, who during colonial times described it as “The Gulf of Good Weather.” Nothing would be more pleasurable for this explorer than to find his way to this paradise after a long journey from the Old Continent, than to disembark the entire crew of La Nina, La Pinta and La Santa Maria for a good relaxing time. A delicious weather is among its charms, characterized by a warm spring throughout the year, that also fuels the contagious festive and spontaneous spirit of its people. You may enjoy the luxury of our new ‘Royal Decameron Cornwall,’ a modern property with Caribbean and tropical style, with a vacation infrastructure located on a private beach that gives it its name, and only 5 minutes from the Sir Donald Sangster International Airport, and the commercial district of Montego Bay and its ‘Hit Strip.’ You may also explore fascinating geographical locations in Jamaica from our resort, such as the ‘Dunn River Waterfalls,’ the ‘Blue Mountains National Park,’ go river rafting on the ‘Martha Brae River,’ swim with dolphins or visit the ‘Bob Marley House – Museum.’ Due to Coronavirus (COVID-19), this property is taking steps to help protect the safety of guests and staff. Certain services and amenities may be reduced or unavailable as a result.",

I'm glad I booked with them.\n\nClean and quiet rooms. AC worked without a problem. Very friendly staff. The only time I experienced rudeness was when making a reservation to the Jamaican restaurant, but that was at the other hotel.  \n\nI had no problem with their food. They provided a variety of fruit and veggies.  This was my first time trying jerk chicken, and I liked it!\n",

                  "text": "I came to the S Hotel with a friend to celebrate her birthday. Upon check in there were additional fees to pay for which were not discussed when booking over the phone. We received a cold towel and welcome drink which was refreshing. It is an indoor/outdoor hotel so keep that in mind that only your room and restaurants will be air conditioned. \n\nRoom:\nUpon arrival to our room, we found that even though it was clean, there were deep stains in the floor. The building and rooms could use repair. You can tell they just keep layering on paint. The beds were very comfortable! The robes came in 1 size which is an XL but fits like a M. The water from the sink splashes water everywhere even at low pressure. The showers were very nice. Room service is slow and if you ask for anything, they will give you part of what you asked for or nothing at all. It was incredibly disappointing. \n\nFood/Drinks:\nWe had some really good food while dining. The breakfast and lunch were good. Service was great! The problem we had is that the restaurants are not all open every night and you can only get dinner at 6 or 8pm. I’ve never experienced anything like that at resorts. They do not have many restaurants to choose from either. The best one, of the ones I could experience, was the Rock Steady. It’s on the top floor. We never got a chance to try the steakhouse. They will tell you to book restaurants early but then the restaurants are empty so make it make sense. The bartenders are really cool! You will need to ask them to add liquor to your drinks. They are pretty weak. \n\nPool/Beach:\nThe main pool is small but very cute. The rooftop pool gives a beautiful view of the ocean. We loved it!\n\nStaff:\nThe staff were very pleasant and easy to discuss things with. Daroyl/Darrel is awesome!! Be very clear in your ask, especially for pricing of excursions or drivers. Make them give you a complete breakdown of costs. \n\nOverall, I had a good time with friends and enjoyed the staff. I’ve stayed at some nice resorts with better amenities for less money and high end ones as well. I wouldn’t return to this resort.",

During my last visit the hotel was transitioning into an all-inclusive and for this trip, is now a fully adult all-iclusive get away. More restaurants are now added but I particularly like the jerk centre, the 24 hour cafe not to be out done the general  eating area which still serves excellent food. The service is superb as was expected.\nMy slight disappointment was not seeing some of the familiar staff that I had grown accustomed to seeing. Nothwithstanding, their replacements are obviously well trained and exceptionally pleasant. I would recommend this diamond to anyone trying to find an enjoyable hotel in Jamaica to ty the S Hotel and please remember to check out the Jamaican Friday evening food...excellent!  \n\n",

                  "text": "We went for 7 days as a couple to get away. Let’s do the positives first! \n\n-The location and facilities are beautiful. The beach area is small while their doing a renovation in one section. \n-The food in all locations was great as I don’t think we had a bad meal. \n\nSo the negatives which comes down to management of the facility really needs to get on some major things. Yes it seems like a lot but remember we paid $6K for a top of the line All Inclusive Resort. \n\n-The plane noise flying only couple hundred feet directly above you is really loud during the day and early evening \n-The Staff at the beach bar are not so friendly. No smiles or trying to interact with you . This compared to Pool bar where Bartender Black was  friendly and inviting. \n-Bomb Bay dinner took over an hour when we eat at 8 PM and only a couple people in the entire restaurant.\n-We left are room all day and left the clean room light on.  No one ever came and I had to go to the front desk to have it cleaned.\n-The Fire Alarm went off while simple taking a showering for 15 minutes.\n-During the fire Dance on beach. The whole time they were working on the beach grill with electric Saws and couldn’t  hear. How could someone in charge allow this to happen with 6 staff present.\n-The Reggae band was hour late setting up and only played for 30 minutes. During the delay, we had to watch drunk guest dance on the stage to entertain us. \n-The Main bathroom near the lounges and entrance was Unisex. So while I was in at the stand up going a lady came in and was horrified and walked out. I apologize to her when I left and she said of course not my fault.\n-Every night two bus loads of guest left our resort to the sister resort for dinner and entertainment. Entertainment needs a lot of work. \n-At 6AM on Tuesday and Friday the workers using blowers to blow around our front door waking us up. \n\nI actually left some stuff out. Whoever the manager is needs to get working!",

                  "text": "My husband and I just got back from our first Sandals trip. We stayed at Royal Carribean in Montego Bay June 17-24, 2023.  We are fortunate enough to travel quite a bit and have been to all inclusive resorts as well as non all inclusive resorts. We have several friends that are all \"Sandals Only\" travelers so we were anxious to experience all the wonderful things they have experienced.  Our first few days were not as wonderful as our friends experiences. Granted they have never stayed at this particular resort so that may have been the difference.   The staff members were hit and miss... some gave great customer service while others seemed annoyed being there. \n\nWhile the vacation went on, there were many positives we had that made us think we would be willing to give Sandals another try for a future trip.  Here are the pros and cons:\n\n- DRINKS WERE NOT STRONG!!! Even when requesting extra strong drinks still seemed weak. I really hope it is not true about watered down alcohol but, it sure seemed that way.  We got to the point where we requested super strong drinks and a shot on the side. \n\n-The Pool Bartenders were AWESOME!!! Shout out to Shawayne and Black. They were super friendly and fun. I enjoyed both of them. The Beach Bartenders were NOT friendly and sometimes even rude. On our beach days... I would just walk over to the pool to see Shawayne and Black. \n\n-The Paino Bartender... Okello (might be misspelled, my apologizes) was very friendly and fun! He made the best martinis. YUMMY! \n\n-The grounds were beautiful! The pools and spas were super clean and inviting.\n\n-The beach is small but, very pretty!  The only complaint is you kinda feel like a third class citizen with the butlers reserving all the best and shady spots. I guess it is what is! But when you are paying 6K plus for week... it is frustrating. \n\n-The Food was great overall!!! The Indian, French, and Thai restaurant were wonderful. Friendly staff.   Special shout out to Robert in the French restaurant.... top notch customer service by him! Italian restaurant was just ok.\n\n- We did have one not so great experience at Spices Restaurant for dinner. We arrived to the hostess desk and while standing there another couple arrived after us with a butler. The butler escorted them past us. We were told to have a seat and wait. Again.. I get it. They had a butler but, it was still frustrating when you are paying a lot of money too. We noticed that couple had finished their meal and left before our meal even arrived. \n\n-We splurged for a couple massage overlooking the beach! It was fabulous. The ladies put us to sleep! Strongly recommend. \n\n-Unfortunately, the night of our Butches reservations (over at the Montego Bay Resort), my husband got very dizzy (he was not drinking this day) while getting ready for dinner. He almost fell but, caught himself. We decide to have him get checked by the nurse on call. She was so compassionate. She checked him and thought it was an ear infection. She called the on call doctor. It only took about an hour for the doctor to arrive and confirm the diagnosis. Afterwards, we were told to get him back to the hotel room for rest. They took care of getting the meds delivered to our room in less than two hours. This company that Sandals contracts for medical care is top notch! Yes, we had to pay out of pocket and submit later to our insurance company... but, it was well worth it!!! This was when we said.. perhaps we will try Sandals again. It is comforting to be in foreign country and know if you get sick... there is something on grounds and they will take care of meds if needed! I went to desk to tell the manager on duty, Tadean. I requested that since we missed dinner, would we be able to get room service even though we were not in a room that did not offered that.  Tadean took care of it for us! And my husband was able to rest and not worry about food. \n\n-  The Entertainment staff was friendly and fun! And they are very talented. I wish there was better communication with the Themed nights. The App was not very specific about what the shows were exactly just the title. We missed the Fire Show on the Beach.  The flyer we were given at check in was vague too.  The screen in the lobby did not always work. ",

If you are staying in the preferred club section defiantly request Darwin and Ta' jae, they were consistently checking on us to make sure “we were good’ and pampered.  They were GREAT butlers  who made our anniversary memorable that we can’t stop talking about it.  There service was exceptional and should be tipped accordingly.\n\n Blue Mountain Jamaican food improved immensely from our last visit and himatsu was fabulous and the chef very entertaining. \n\n Thank you to  bellman Chris Brown who remembered us because we are repeaters at the resort and always had a smile.  Ja’Nelle  made check-in a good experience to make sure we received  the room we wanted.  Payrian our housekeeper kept our room sanitized and clean with plenty of wash cloths and towels.  Shout out to Dowain the bartender at the Marlin who knew my favorite drink “Jamaican Memories”.  Thank you Shanice our concierge who remember us as repeaters and was so pleasant to talk too.\n\nI suggest that the general managers walk the grounds and meet the people.  Hospitality to your customers will go a long way. You may  learn more about your employees and what what you are doing right and what needs improvement ",

The all-inclusive is NOT worth the price at all.  There is basically 1 restaurant open for breakfast, 1 for lunch and 1 for dinner everyday.  The food was mediocre at best.\nAs well, the service is lacking.  I booked a spa package through AMR/Hyatt before arriving, and the location had no idea what I was talking about despite being owned by AMR/Hyatt.  I had to discuss this with at least 5 people, show my confirmation, AND they still asked to see that it was charged to my credit card before they would honor it.  SOOOOO frustrating.",

We were early for check in, but the team managed to get us in our room an hour before check in, which was great!\nWe were given 2 butlers, Michael-Lee and Kyle. They were so friendly and no request was too much. They came and found us daily and checked we were having a great time, and always made sure we had a drink in hand. They use a whatsapp system to contact them, which is very efficient! They even decorated our room on arrival and additionally. for my birthday with balloons and flowers during our stay. \nThe bar staff at the hotel were so fun and friendly. We have to especially mention Barbara in the Lobby bar. She is so lively and kind. When I had a bad sunburn, she found me some fresh aloevera. She also, would whip up a cocktail on request of what you were fancying. The Bob Marley frozen cocktail is amazing! Kerman in the Polo lounge was so friendly and we had great conversations with him.\nThe resort is quiet, but this is exactly what we needed for our honeymoon. Theres live music every other evening, we especially enjoyed the steel drum band! Dario the entertainment manager is a character!\nThe breakfast had some great options and the coffee is fab!\nWe had lovely dinners every evening, with different them food cuisine evenings.\nOur only suggestion would be that lunch was a little limiting. We think an everyday special food choice would be great at the Canoa. Jerky Joes is so fun and the Jerk chicken was fab!\nWe really enjoyed the beach as it was less windy than the pool area. They have a nice area for swimming and clean the beach and in the sea everyday!\nThe water sports are fun, and you receive a free snorkeling boat trip in your stay. We saw a turtle!\nThis is a perfect resort for relaxing and unwinding and enjoying good food and friendly staff. And the sunsets are stunning!\nThank you for making our honeymoon so wonderful!\n",

We regret based on your feedback, that you were not satisfied with certain aspects of your stay. We wanted to address and clarify several items from your list above. Just before your arrival we experienced torrential rains which would have caused more natural elements in our ocean, which our beach team works on daily. Our beach has a natural reef which makes our waters more calm. The crab we were told you saw, was removed and put back in the natural environment. We have music systems in all restaurants along with special nights for specific live music. We have a very engaging Caribbean night and Jamaica night events, which you would have been happy with had you stayed for those events. Our Jerky Joe's jerked chicken is known as one of the best in Montego Bay as reviewed by other guests, thus, we will give our Executive Chef your feedback for him to look into this immediately. Once the chicken is grilled a sauce is also provided to use with all parts of the chicken. Thank you for giving us feedback on this.\n\nWe do not ever use dirty glasses at it is not our standard. Your feedback we were informed was that we utilized the polyurethane instead of the glasses by the pool and beach. This is used based on safety reasons so that we do not have any broken glass at poolside or beach. However, we will investigate this further.\n\nZoetry Montego Bay is a naturally beautiful resort, with 49 suites and it is a smaller property when compared to a much larger hotel, but, that is the beauty of this location. We have many locations that are much bigger if this size property is not to your liking. We apologize for your tablet malfunction as was addressed and we also have our stay app which is provided to all guests with the same information and abilities to receive orders. This is currently active for use on property. We are currently with the F&B leader and bar leader investigating your request for spicy virgin Margarita. Your butler is always introduced by front office upon check in by the team and this person takes you and your luggage to the room upon arrival for your orientation, thus, we will find out from front office management further details.\n\nAs a management brand, we are constantly working on improving our Zoetry product. Our brand has been engaging in an extensive beautification product to which is currently in process. That is on going and will continue to improve all aspects of our property. Our employees are known as most kind and caring and certainly you are very important to us as our VIP UVC member. \n\nOur Quality department is investigating thoroughly other details provided and will give us further feedback so that we can have this resolved. Should you have further feedback our quality contact email is quality.zombj@zoetryresorts.com\n\n \nRegards,\n\nCustomer Relations",

Other than that, I’m glad I stayed at this resort. It was quiet as it was pretty small compared to others on the coast.\n\nThere’s a great bartender at the Polo Club, Christopher.

                  "text": "This hotel is meant to be a five star all inclusive property For me it fell well short and is a four star at best and I know that others have picked this up too I’m still at the hotel and can’t wait to leave in 73 hours time Don’t get me wrong I’ve been to several 5 star all inclusive properties all over the Caribbean and this has to be one of the worst value for money\nI came with my wife and two adult daughters for 20 nights and was quoted $11500 for two basic suites. This proved to be double the price as compared to what is available now on the resort on the internet!\nNevertheless the site is idyllic and the facilities are great but it stops there.\n\nThe staff are friendly enough but expect a tip which is wrong for an AI resort and an attitude problem if you cross them, apparently a local trait!\n\nThey say they have ten restaurants but most are shut at lunchtime and lots at dinner so you end up eating at the same basic rubbish ones.\n\nIn fact the food is well below par (except breakfast). . There was no lobster at the lobster restaurant and don’t expect filet steak at the grill either! For the price paid this was real rubbish. The available food doesn’t compare to the other 5 star AI properties in the Caribbean and is often cold due to slow service.\n\nDrinks: I’m not a drinker but was told that top shelf drinks didn’t compare to the other Caribbean hotels.\n\nAnimation: hardly any daytime and a miserable show at night \n\nWater sports They have lazy beach bum staff whose only desire is to sit in their hut doing nothing Everything they do is a favor for you ie kayakina or canoeing. You can go out in a catamaran with one of them especially if you’re female be ready for the chat up but woe to you if you want to catamaran alone. It’s too dangerous they cry but no more dangerous than other resorts I cry. Okay pay $50 and take a test they say. Ok I pay $50 and after 30 mins of sailing we come back and he says nothing except come back tomorrow.The next day a different beach bum tells me that it was too rough to assess me the previous day and that he would. After another uneventful 30 minutes where he tried to chat up my daughters who had come along we came back early the next day and he said that I could have the boat the next day solo. This was a downright lie as the next day he wanted to assess me again (with my daughters). I must add that I’m a licensed hobie 2 sail sailor ir the category above the ones in this resort albeit recovering from cancer so a bit slower to react and move but I never tipped the boat or hit anything during the test and successfully turned it around.\nI declined a third test and went to see the manager who surprise surprise wasn’t in. The deputy manager heard my case and promised to relay my concerns to the manager the next day. The following day the manager wasn’t in again and I saw a hireling who stuck to the bum beach boys rules. I have never seen such poor management in my life! \nDo not believe their polite responses it’s all a facade as they all have an attitude problem when contradicted .\nInstead do boycott the Excellence chain and spend your money in Cancun Mexico home of several lovely memories. I can’t wait to leave this horrible place.",

                  "text": "This was absolutely the worst lodging I have stayed in that is supposed to be a resort. The best part was one of the bartenders in the lobby, he was always pleasant and happy and helpful, and the pool, it's nice and there's a swim up bar, but that's where the \"niceness\" ends for me. \n\nIt's very far from anything worth seeing, at least 45 minutes away from ACTUAL Montego Bay, there's nothing within walking distance for tourists to visit. \n\nThe AC thermostat in the room is basically useless and there for decoration, the 1st night, my room was absolutely freezing, called maintenance and they \"fixed it\", the next day, it was stuffy, called again and I was told there's basically no way to adjust the temperature because the entire hotel is ran off 1 main system....WHY?!?! So all you can really do is adjust the fan speed. \n\nThe elevators are creepy and very small and can really only fit 3 adults before it beeps at you and the door won't close, oh by the way, this is also the same elevator used by staff to transport housekeeping, room service and the beverage carts, we noticed ONE staff elevator, but again...it was small, why is there no actual service elevator??\n\nYou pretty much have to figure out your route closest to your room as there are multiple walkways and signage on the walls aren't as visible as they should be. \n\nAbout 6 restaurants and we tried 3 or 4 and they were all dreadful, bland, sometimes cold food! The cocktails are made WAAAAYYYYYY too sweet and the sodas are flat because they use 2 liter bottles and mini bottles that just sit open and get hot and flat. There's a hibachi restaurant that seemed pretty popular but we never made it because they seem to only cater to those who have a \"privilege\" reservation. Martha's seemed to be the go-to as it is large and buffet style, while they had a large selection of items to chose from, everything was just awful and flavorless, where is the seasoning?? The best thing I had was a rice and gravy beef dish at Red Snapper, but oh....they're only open to all during lunch hours, \"privilege\" only at dinner. Everyone raved about this fried chicken at Route 66 which is open late-night, but get there right when they open if you want it because they run out.....by the way....it too is bland, there's also no menu so they approach your table telling you what they DO have that night. Room service is an absolute joke, there are only 4 things available and only during lunch....unless you are \"privilege\". The pizza that came to my room.....I've had better school lunch pizza in the 80s. Oh and DON'T look for bottled water anywhere because they don't have any!! But they stock the rooms with it....how does that make sense??\n\nThe tile in the shower was nasty in my room and I showered in my flip flops every day, it's like they just do not have the proper cleaning solutions to remove the soap scum or whatever it is. The towel stocking is very inconsistent, I'm glad I brought my own face towel, some days I got no hand towels, some days 1 face towel. \n\nThe beach isn't pleasant at all, the water is nasty and filled with algae and seaweed and the beach is rocky. The so-called bar on the beach, the employees seemed less than enthused to be working. \n\nThere's a coffee shop on the premises, a jewelry store, a sports bar with a club attached to it (that plays an awful mix of 90s/early 2000s songs that nobody wants to hear), and a ridiculously expensive souvenir shop, which you're pretty much stuck shopping at if you never leave the resort. \n\nNothing felt like being in Jamaica besides the accents of the staff, it really felt like I was on a cruise ship as there were \"dance lessons\" conducted at the pool every day.....to the same songs!\n\nAll in all....this was my 1st trip to Jamaica and I was really looking forward to it and this resort left a bad taste in my mouth, but I know there are other places and resorts so I will need a do over so I can actually thoroughly enjoy myself, and have good food and drinks. \n",

                  "text": "A group of us decided to try a new location . We came to Riu Montego Bay the year before and we also have been to Ocho Rios but decided to try a new location. The resort in my opinion is the cleanness and pretties we been to . The drive is not long but not short i would say about 40 minutes . The airport was a little busy so free tip if you can get in before 12pm that's going to help you . If you cannot get in early use Club mobay Vip its a easy way to get out of the airport its easy to google up . Once we got to the resort we could see its was new . The option for food is great i would say more than enough for our group and nobody had any complaints . If i was to nip pick i was expecting to see the soursopfruit but they didnt have any and its a great drink i had last year around this time of travel its extremely good with ice . The people are friendly and helpful and i met Crystal from the sales department at the back to the beach was one of the best conversations i had shes an excellent worker .  The entertainment was good and those people work overtime you will not be disappointed i can say its the best entertainment there . We tried all the activites including bowling and it was fun . The beach is clean and taken care of we were worried about seaweed but it wasnt an issue . Jeldean is the best omeltte maker ive met at the resort try and find her you will love them . For airport private transfers i booked with Top choice Jamaica Tours and they also arranged our Atv,zip line and dunns river falls tours .  The dunebuggy tour was a bit of a drive back to montego bay but it was so worth it . Rasta Safari was the name it was awesome fresh fruits jamaica local riding and we learned alot . I can say there extremally dependable and have been using them for 3 years now .  Desmond is great at making drinks you need so visit him at the bar and remember the name . Everyone in Jamaica made our trip great and this one was special since it was my best friends anniversary . These are all the tips i can offer which has helped me so i hope others have a better experience .  Tip all your workers and drivers brings 20s 10s 5s and 1 dollars is really all you need we had about $400 in tips with us . Have about $2000 for excursions for options . The people love USD cash dont change it at the airport its a huge lost for all .",

                  "text": "First and foremost, if you have made this reservation and there’s a way for you to get out of it and select another resort don’t wait another second. Feel completely duped by Air Canada vacations and a ridiculous five star rating that this resort purports to be.\n\nIf you cannot change your plans, some quick advice which really won’t change your experience but at least you will know before you go. Firstly go to the bank and pull out at least US$2-300 in ones and fives, you will need this because no staff person will even make eye contact unless you were holding money in your hand. The blatant tipping culture, is one thing, however with some exceptions, the staff are rude and do not want to help at all even with money in hand. \n\nSecond prepare yourself for low end mediocre food, especially in the marthas market, route 66, red snapper and Jamaica grill, where it is 2 star motel level. Again if you want to have anything that is “better“, it’s on the menu for a $50 usd up-charge, but don’t expect this to change the quality.\n\nOn the positive side, the pool is huge and clean and well-maintained. Also the housekeeping staff are thorough and room was in good repair and well serviced by the cleaning staff. \n\nSpecifics\n- gym small and some equipment in disrepair, ok not 5 star. But the worst is no sanitizing wipes anywhere\n- Needed extra toilet paper one evening as wife was unwell, went to front desk but they insisted to send someone, the guy that brought it to the room wouldn’t hand it over without a $5 tip at the door at 11pm\n- The bars..where to start: understaffed  to be sure and hand washing plastic cups in front of customers because they are constantly running short. The cups are picked up in dirty plastic bags which are dumped right on the bar and rewashed by hand as you wait! All the mix comes from plastic soda bottles left open and warm. The beer taps constantly malfunction and run out often. Never mind as mentioned they won’t even look at you if you don’t have cash in hand. Do not expect proper drinks you would get at any basic bar, more like a frat party level of the cheapest standards, with the slowest and rudest service.\n- With all the tipping needed, the atm charges $7 service fee to get cash out. Then there is nowhere to get small bills except back out from to the bellmen. They will change your money but not without a $5 tip!\n- As mentioned in other reviews there are not enough umbrellas by the pool, so if your not at the pool to get your towels down forget it. Also discovered a new trick near end of trip, the pool attendants take the metal pins from umbrellas, yes it will cost you to get one from them…$ . Also if your not up by 6am your chances of getting an umbrella is nil, and a lounge chair is 50/50 as they are all taken\n- In the restaurants impossible to get reservations, so end up eating at cafeteria for dinners. Waiter brings drinks sometimes in 15 mins or doesn’t at all. Order the wine and we learned guests can at least get up to serve themselves.\n- The coffee shop in the morning is staffed by just two poor people stuck serving a huge lineup, I feel so bad for them no wonder you can tell they hate the guests and their jobs. Expect to wait at least 15 mins for a tiny cup of latte or cappuccino. At one point saw what appeared to be a manager come in finally to maybe take charge, he looked at the huge lineup of annoyed guests. To my shock he gets behind the counter, makes himself a coffee and walks back outside. Stunned..\n\nIn summary if they advertised a 3 star and it was an incredible deal at half of what we paid, most of this would still be completely unacceptable. However stating they are ‘5 stars’ is the kicker, not only would we never stay here again (even if they paid me), there is zero chance we will ever return to Jamaica. What a waste of money but more importantly valuable family time ruined for a week we can’t get back. Blame rests squarely on bad management, there is simply no one in charge here. The owners need to get a professional operator and clean this mess up, as structurally the resort is beautiful, just so badly managed. Far too many great choices to pick from in Caribbean, do your self and family a favour avoid at all costs!",

The staff were all rude and miserable and made it seem like you were bothering them when asking for assistance, they would complain to their coworkers about having to serve us, the food was horrible, it had no flavor and they barely had caribbean food on the buffet, no ackee and saltfish with fry dumpling, nothing of that sort. you would expect to go to jamaica and get caribbean food, its more of an american cuisine & every single drink is watered down, its like they make it sit for a while and then put ice in it and serve it, i never leave reviews but because of my experience with this hotel and their unprofessional staff and unflavored food im letting the people know to not waste their money. i asked a friend that stayed here before me how it was and was told the service was bad and staff are prejudice but i didn’t believe it, wish i listened to him. you spend so much money just to be disappointed with bad service, the entertainment by snow was the best part of my stay at the hotel, the all white party was good and the silent party was sooo fun. big up snow for the positive energy and vibes.",

Vanessa Johnson did a superb job of keeping our room neat and refreshed.  The  services provided by Nadine, Vanessa, Rohan and Shaneka at the pool made our pool visits delightful.  DJ \"HQ\" played some great music.  Tyrese and Wayne provided excellent service for our Cabana.  Jason at the Martini Bar and Jehneil and Raymond at the Lobby Bar were excellent mixologists.  Ruthann at Guest Services was tremendously helpful in arranging various events for my wife's birthday celebration.   David at the Buffet was friendly and helpful during our visits to the Buffet for dining.   Overall we had a wonderful stay and plan to return again in the not too distant future.  ",

Most of the gifts look like they were made in China . We were taken to Margaritaville when we wanted to see the seven mile beach not another tourist trap .We were so disappointed in the whole tour .

The food was awful except the buffet. some of the staff was really nice and some act like we owed them something. my girlfriends and i wanted to relax but kept getting bothered by ppl wanting to sell us things.\n\nmy biggest complaint is diamond members are in the back part of the hotel away from the main part of the hotel and the walk is a distance the hotel does not offer caddy rides after 11pm",

                  "text": "I am a returning resident havent been home in years so i was looking forward to coming to Negril the last time i was here i was in my teens . I took 2 flights to get here and the drive took a while felt like 2hrs so i highly recommend unless you love sitting on a bus waiting for people then use a private taxi i used Top choice Jamaica tours and i can say i was impressed with the service and consistency from online response to drivers i never expected it from local drivers its been a while for me . Anyways lets talk about the resort it looks great and i have no issues with the local staff . I do have an issue with the towels and i believe better management to oversea them might be really needed  I was there 6 nights and 3 days by 11am they were gone . I didn't get any oxtail that was very disappointing because thats what i came thinking i would get .  Jamaicans love oxtail please fix this . The drinks were okay entertainment people worked extremely hard . I did learn a few dance moves to bring back to home . I would say the beaches were clean not over spectacular . I would have prefer more local beats being played i beleive people coming here dont want to hear the same songs there use to . Im a coffe guy and the coffee was good . Jerk chicken was okay but the one at best in the west was so much better . I saw 2 weddings and they seem happy . My room was big clean and i had an ocean view . It did rain a bunch but i still had fun with my crew . I would say its not perfect and maybe i was expecting alot more maybe it was this time . I would come back to see if the food options are better but overall theres nothing here to say oh they ruin my vacation . The staff work hard ill say it again managment where are you and i will leave it just at that . PS Yanique is a great worker .",

Different variety each day, all tasted lovely, the drinks and cocktails all tasted lovely, not cheap and nasty which is sometimes what you get when you go to all inclusive, sun loungers all the time you can get, mini bar daily stocked up, beach/pool towels can get anytime and how ever many you would like, totally different to a all inclusive in Europe!

                  "text": "It’s incredibly difficult to enjoy your vacation when you are woken up out of your bed due to a fire alarm!!! My husband and I had to exit the building in our pajamas in the middle of the night. There were several staff on the outside that provided no direction for guests. Guests got tired of being outside and just went back in the building. We had absolutely no idea if the building was safe to go back into or not (had no idea if it was on fire on just a false alarm). Families with kids we’re woken up out of their sleep. It was a nightmare. Then when everyone got back to their rooms, it went off in the building next to us. We had to pop our head out the room to see if it was our building again. A concierge member called the next morning to ask how our stay was going. I asked if they knew why the alarm went off and they simply replied they weren’t aware it had gone off - there weren’t any notes left for them and they would look into it.\n\nBut wait… there’s more! The fire alarm went off in various parts of the resort 6 times in 36 hours (that we witnessed). It went off the next night while we were sleeping again. Went off in the buffet while we were eating dinner the next night. Never received a response from the concierge, but the next day when I went to the front desk they reported that the alarm from the first night was someone smoking in their room. They had no idea about the others as they hadn’t been able to “investigate” them yet. They also took no responsibility on their staff’s inability to communicate to their guests on whether the building was safe to enter or not. We also inquired about their protocols for evacuation, because some guests never even left their rooms when the alarms went off. They looked at me without an answer. Heavens forbid if there really was a fire, because you are on your own.\n\nAlso, we had reservations at the Italian restaurant. We waited an hour and a half for our food. Then only 3 out of 4 guests in our party were served and we were told that the other persons food was coming. All three of us finished our food and the other persons plate never arrived.",

I brought the bug repellant, but never had to use it. I brought the towel clips, but it probably wasn’t necessary. I brought extra sunscreen, but the gift shop sunscreen was not as expensive as some said. Even the comments about clothes not drying overnight was not an issue for us because we had a very comfortable air-conditioned room that dried our bathing suits and wet clothing just fine. Used the resort transportation from airport, no problems. Bottom line, if you are not “high maintenance”,  you will love CSA. Beautiful grounds, wonderful food, friendly people, superb staff, awesome options for excursions and things to do, and gorgeous beach and water!!\nCan’t wait to go back.",

                  "text": "This was our third visit to Couples Swept Away. I have read other reviews this time before going to see what others thought.\n\nI would agree the resort is getting a bit dated, but I am not there to live in a room but to enjoy the beach. The rooms were clean, and the cleaning staff did a great job. It’s only dated because nothing has changed over the years. Is that bad? In this case, I really don’t think it is. Our room had air conditioning and you can set them to whatever your comfort level is. At night you can hear the music and occasional traffic but most of that stops after 10pm. \nThe food was good. The main buffet had adequate choices and a few nights per week you can order from a menu which was a nice touch. The restaurants that required a reservation were even better. They could be a bit more efficient with the omelet and pasta stations, and that could be easily remedied with placement of product and better trained cooks. But it was bearable. My wife said their house wine was good. I had the liquor, and it was perfectly fine. \nThe beach and the included activities are what makes this place shine. It’s what most others we talked to really raved about and of course I would agree. It can be relaxing if you choose, or it can be active if you take part in all the included water activities. Only part of Jamaica I don’t like is the constant annoyance of the local beach vendors. I can only imagine what it would be like without them constantly trying to sell you something. I don’t understand why this concept has continued to go on when so many see it as a negative to their experience on the beach. I understand they need to make a living, but I suspect there are a few alternatives for them. The approved vendors who had tables to set up their goods was a very pleasant experience, and they were not pushy at all. \nIf you love a beach with activities, this is the place for you. The staff in general where pleasant and the wait staff in the buffet were always filling up our water and asking if we wanted another drink. They were well trained and alert at most times. \nFor the negative, we had a few, most not worth mentioning. I do need to mention one item that was noticeable this time around. I don’t think I ever noticed it prior. Maybe it’s the age group or post covid but the amount of tipping I witnessed was a bit alarming. To the point that it was getting to be expected. I did notice a service level difference with those who did and trust me word got around who was a good tipper and those that did not. I had to start tipping just to avoid being ignored. I think the staff need a reminder to simply refuse the tipping. I also understand that most probably made a subsistence level income. It’s management’s responsibility to make sure they are paid fairly in line with the other resorts. Once tipping starts, it’s very hard to stop and makes the vacationers uneasy and starts to generate a two-class system of visitors. Another alternative is to simply allow it and let the chips fall where they shall. It’s hard for me to tip a bartender when I go to the bar and get 2 drinks. However, it's much easier for me to tip a person carrying luggage all day. I will let the resort figure out a solution. I simply want to say I have witnessed it on more than one occasion there this time around. \nWould I go again. Yes, this is a good place for a good price. The staff are friendly, they are for the most part doing things right. It’s a shame it takes around 2 hours to get there from the airport. You can fly from the airport to Negril but it’s expensive. I know the people there get taxed around 13% for sales they make, and the resorts also get taxed. I must ask, where does this money go? It’s not infrastructure as I have witnessed no improvements in 5 years. I can only imagine if the roads were done nicely how much more traffic the resorts might get or even the local stores. It’s a shame the money we spend there doesn’t seem to be given back to the people in the form of local utilities and infrastructure improvements.  \n",

This is by far my best holiday I have ever been on. \nFirstly the staff are the most friendliest I have ever met they actually made our holiday. Big shout out to Kenroy and George at the pool side bar!! We had so much laughter here and the drinks were amazing. The staff in the Nightclub (RJ) and we have forgotten some names were all so nice. And all of the dinner staff everyone was so nice we cannot name them all. \nMe and my husband loved our room. The tree frogs you hear at night are amazing and there is so much to do on site.\nWe tried the bob marley trip and dunns river falls. This is a whole day trip and did take us from 6.30am un till 7.30pm but totally worth it. Our guide was amazing and kept giving us information about Jamaica.\nWe took the free glass bottom boat ride and the captain was hilarious. Made the trip.\nAll food was amazing I didn't eat anything the same. There were different restaurants and all had very different food. The daily grill made food to order and its delicious!!\nWe didn't find any waiting for food.\nCats are not an issue from reading other reviews. There are not loads we counted 5 and they don't bother you at all if you don't want them too. They are not around you when eating.\nWhen we arrived on the first night we were greeted so well. Hot towels and champagne. \nThe acts were very good and we watched whilst eating a meal. If you want to party a little the piano bar is good and they open the Nightclub untill you are ready to leave.\nWe had our room opposite the Nightclub and you cannot hear it from our room as it is located upstairs.\n\nHonestly we will be back yearly it was so good!! Cannot wait to see you again Couples Resort from a very chilled out couple wishing they were there now in the UK.",

We loved it.  We went back in March of 2017 and they had a new manager, this is when we started seeing things go down hill.  It was so crowded in March with regulars who go every March. We decided never to go in March again. The last time we went was the LAST! The staff is miserable. There are a few that you can tell are taken care of by the regulars , but most walk around with a frown on their face and the bar tender we had was horrible. never made eye contact with us never smiled. They have run out of alcohol every time we have stayed there. The food is sub par and not worth paying for.Plan on buying your own beer too because they run out often. Plus all they offer is the regular redstripe. They dont even have the light Red Stripe beer. This place is owned by Sandals and they treat their employees awfully.  We had ONE employee that we loved there and he always was smiling. He left and went to Sandals to work. DO NOT STAY HERE. The rooms are run down and old. Our toilet over flowed three times we had to have it fixed. They painted the outside of these places to all light blue and took out the shutters. That took away the Caribbean vibe and they did nothing to improve the inside of the rooms. Stay anyplace but here. Horrible, Stay at any other place but here. Food and Drinks they include are limited and awful. ",

Enjoyed last years bowl by accident, and returned for this years by design.  A lot of the same returning guests each year on this weekend.  Fun to see them again.  They put out a snack buffet during the game and also were serving dinner at that time.  Watching the super bowl on the beach in Negril in February equals a lot of fun.  \n\nThis place is fun, some what quiet, and very relaxing.  If you like to relax and just chill,  this could be your place.  It has become my favorite place.  It's not fancy,  you won't get knocked off your feet with amenities.  But it checks all the boxes for my wife and I.  I have noticed the last couple of years that feedback has lead to improvements.  The buildings on the beachside have been painted.  I thought they looked very nice.  The bathroom in our room looked as if it had been painted and freshened up some.  We have stayed in this particular room before.  Windows in the rooms have replaced the old glass shutter type windows.  I have noticed subtle changes in the food service for the better.  The deserts continue to please.  We always enjoy going out for dinner a night or two to nearby businesses. The only suggestion  my wife would have, to offer yogurt at breakfast each morning.  More of a dietary request.  A couple of mornings when it wasn't on the buffet, she asked and was able to get it from the kitchen.  \n\nThe only suggestion that I have would be to keep the band playing longer on the nights that they are there.  At times it  is nice just to sit and chill, after dinner, and listen and have fun with the band.  Yes there are several places nearby  to enjoy entertainment,  but it is really nice to hang at the Pineapple and enjoy the evening.\n\nI have always enjoyed the employees of GPB.  All have been friendly and willing to help in any way.  Marvette, Jeffroy always greet us upon our return.  Everitt keeps the grounds looking top notch all the time.  Already booked for next year for the Super bowl.",

From the moment you check in, the welcome is not very warm and things go down hill from there. The staff are friendly but you can tell they are not happy in their work. If you want want a drink past 10pm you will need to go to the supermarket and buy your own because they frequently run out. The food is not the best either; if there is something half decent to eat in the trays it soon disappears and there’s a long wait to refill, so be prepared to go out and eat somewhere else, there are some nice restaurants near by. The returners dinner was a joke! We were served RAW steak, most of the people I spoke to either sent it back or couldn’t eat it (and good luck if you’re a vegetarian as your meal may never arrive). Overall we won’t be returning for the 5th time unless some drastic changes take place...shame",

First year was good, last year 2 double beds but were promised if we returned king size bed for sure. This year didn't even have a cottage for us that we paid for, we were put in the Manor. Third day we were put in a cottage and had to move luggage ourselves. We asked for some money refunded because we were out for 3 days. They gave us a $20 voucher for gift shop. Wow!!  This was going to be our annual March vacation but time to rethink. Staff and beach are awesome. Management needs a lot of work",

The staff is great ! The one thing I really like about this place is that its very quaint. This isn’t a 5 star resort so if that’s what you want, don’t come here. That is the one reason I come here. I’m not real fond of the snobby people that usually go to those resorts. This place is laid back and quiet for the most part. Alfreds next door can keep you up if you are close to the beach. The guys and girls on the beach selling stuff can get a little overwhelming sometimes, but usually understand a polite no thank you.There are only a few things I would like to see different. I would love to see an updated salad bar and more variety on the food choices. The breakfast egg station needs to keep more omelet ingredients all the way until 10. Some of us like to sleep in on vacation. Oh yeah, please cook the bacon CRISPY !!!! Other than that everything is irie. Great beach,  with lots to do if you want.  We booked our return trip next February. I can’t wait to get back to Jamaica. ",

                  "text": "A great week at H2.  This was our first trip to Hedonism II but not our first trip to a lifestyle resort.  We try to take a lifestyle vacation every year but other things keep us from being able to do it.  \n\nOur experience at H2 was very good and we didn't know what to expect in comparison to the other resorts we have been too.  We will say it was a very fun week and depending on where you are in the lifestyle you can find a flavor that meets what you want.  One thing we love about Hedo is there is plenty of room to do what caters to what you want at the resort.  We probably mixed it up throughout the week.   So here is our take:\n\nNude Beach / Pool Area:\nWe spent most of our week at the nude beach and most days we would spend the later afternoon hours in the pool with the fun.  Since we are beach people we prefer the beach.   The pool is fun and the activities will definitely keep you laughing and entertained.  You can feel free to do your thing in the pool and others will enjoy as well and participate.   The Mrs. is hard of hearing so when the pool fun cranks up it can be hard to have a conversation but definitely a good time.  \n\nWe love the fact that we can walk up to the bar and grabs drinks as well as eat lunch at the grill at the nude beach. \n\nClothing Optional Beach:\nThere were a few days where the sargassum seaweed took over the nude beach so we moved down the the clothing optional beach for this simple reason.  After a few days they had the sargassum cleaned up.  We found the clothing optional beach very relaxing and quiet.  While some don't strip down most do but that's not an issue for us.  The Flame grill is close by for lunch and the bar at the clothing optional pool is easy to get too.  One thing about the clothing optional beach that we discovered with some new friends we met was the far end towards Sandals in the evening you can chill on the beach and watch the sunsets.  Very nice and calming.\n\nFood Options:\nThe food was great and there were plenty of options to mix it up.  We mixed it up throughout the week and were pleased with every dining location.  \n\nEntertainment:\nThe shows were fun every evening and the piano bar was a great place to hit   after the shows.  Most evenings we would watch the show and then hang out in the main dining for a while or move to the piano bar or one of the bar areas to simply chat with our friends and new found friends.\n\nOther Stuff and Activities:\nThe walk down 7 Mile Beach is nice and we enjoyed checking out the shops along the way.  Half the fun is talking with the locals trying to sell us stuff some legal and most not.  Always entertaining conversations.  Taking your vanilla pictures along the beach is proof if your kids ask that you went to another resort. LOL\n\nWe used the dive shop to take snorkeling trips and glass bottom boat trips.  Marcus was a great and funny as hell.   If you want you can also sail, surf sail and scuba dive but we simply didn't do those.  Plenty of stuff to do. \n\nKuma Sutra:\nWe did the couples tantric massage and lets just say it was very relaxing and  enlightening.  Read up on what it is and discuss as a couple before you take the plunge.  We highly recommend it.  \n\nSo overall we love the place.  The staff was great, we felt the service was great and the resort is beautiful.  The rooms were a little small for our taste but not a deal breaker by any means.  The daily room service was great and our room was always cleaned and refreshed every day.\n\nThanks to the Hedo staff for a great experience and we will be back very soon.",

                  "text": "My husband and I came to Hedo for the first time ever in June. And wow, what an outstandingly awesome experience! We loved the food, the entertainment, the pool parties, the staff, and made many sexy and/or meaningful connections with other guests. This is truly such a unique place and you can be sure that we'll be back.\n\nI especially wanted to mention about the experiences we had at the Kama Sutra Palace. We did 4/5 of the free hour-long workshops on tantric meditation/sex practices and they were wonderful - hard to describe, you would just have to experience them. We have already tried some of the new sex positions, and the results are both ecstatic and relationship-deepening.\n\nWe also had a one-hour tantric massage with Carlo and Rosie. I still get the warm fuzzies when I think about it. So different from a conventional massage. Not really sexual, Carlo and Rosie were 100% appropriate at all times... but at the same time *deeply* sexual in that one of us had a sort of all-over-body orgasm that lasted for a looong time.What they teach you at Kama Sutra Palace transcends raw animal sexuality and quick orgasms by a lot, it just elevates sex and how we treat each other to a potential whole new plane. \n\nWe talked about it after the massage and they said that is actually their goal with these workshops. Carlo and Rosie are lovely people, beautiful human beings who just happen to have Jedi-level mastery over the tantric and energetic arts. HIGHLY recommended. They said they're going to come up with some new workshops for next year - so now we can't wait to come back!",

The hotel staff was excellent and any issue we brought up was taken care of nearly on the spot. I feel that the four restaurants were difficult to get into, as they were booked up and reservations were not available. We tried to set it up the day we got there and only were able to get into two of the four, and we were there for 6 nights. I would be noce to be able to see the restaurant schedule on your website, instead of just available times.  There were also tables available each time we were in, but reservations were booked, evidently people booked and did not show, so those table should be made available to 1st come1st serve basis.",

                  "text": "It's hard to even start this review because words don't quite capture how special this place is. We booked a standard room, and we still very much enjoyed every aspect of this hotel. Huge value in this resort for how clean and unique it is.  The things that REALLY shine, are the location, tranquility of the cliffs and the ability to just jump off from multiple places into a bath warm ocean with snorkeling, and seculded beach chairs facing a gorgeous cliff ocean hotel. Just as spectacular as the location is the STAFF. We can't say enough about every person we met, they are clearly taken well care of a trained and seem to like their jobs. They are attentive, kind, happy and remarkably fun. Front desk took very good care of us when we had a room concern (nothing major at all). Our standard room had everything we needed and a place to just lay out heads as we preferred hanging by the cliffs near the pool and really like the 2 for 1 happy hour at the pool bar. We stayed 3 nights and it was long enough but 4 or 5 would have been more than welcomed.there was this weird ability to \"shut down\" completely and it felt like a tranquil and happy peice of heaven. This is a remarkably BEAUTIFUL resort. We did the complimentary yoga on the Tues and liked it a lot. We rented flippers and brought our own snorkel gear and the flippers were 3 bucks for the day each. Super reasonable. Beds are comfortable and rooms very clean. We did explore outside the resort for food, and really enjoyed next door, some local grub at sips and bites. Ask to take it to go and eat it on the cliffs while reading and tanning. It's all very close by. We heard the restaurant was lovely and pushcart has a a DJ night life but we were early to rise, early to bed to enjoy outside the most during the day. We even walked to Rick's and wasn't really impressed as Rockhouse is superior in every way without the hoards of tourists. This is a bucket list place, and a must do.  I paddle boarded every morning too and saw sting rays and fun things way down deep in the water but it was very safe. I checked out a lot of cliff front places. Once we got there we walked down the road and checked the other places out. This resort is the best one for our budget, no doubt. Only room tip I have is for the extra 50 bucks do the studios as they are just farther from the road. If you have the budget for the villa it definitely will kick up the luxury. We are just greatful to the lovely WONDERFUL staff for making our stay super special and we will be back. We especially felt great after finding out how much they really give back to supporting local schools and are farm to table with their food being grown around the corner. It's business run as it should with the intent to creat an amazing experience AND be socially responsible. This place is remarkably special. We miss you all and will be back - Walker and Tammy.",

                  "text": "We had a wonderful stay at Rockhouse - the property and water is truly spectacular!\n\nROOMS:\nMost rooms were booked out for our dates and as we needed an extra bed for our 13yo we settled on the Deluxe Studio.  The price of Deluxe Studio is really great value if you are more adventurous and less inclined to spend time in your room except for sleeping etc.\nThe studio rooms are in a great position on the large property, right near the main pool.  The rooms themselves were large enough and clean.  The issue with these rooms though is they are VERY dark with little natural light.  They also do not have glass windows, so you hear every noise that comes through the bug screens and shutters.  Lots of mosquitos as well, though the hotel supplied bug spray in each room.  Housekeeping fantastic.  We enjoyed our room for the price and it was only 3 nights, however, for a longer stay I would have preferred a villa or the new rooms behind the pool.  The main issue for us was how dark the rooms were and the fact they had no proper windows.\n\nGROUNDS:\nThe property is so unique which is what makes it so special.  The water is unbelievable and makes for a fun trip.  We spent most of our days swimming, using the free paddle boards which are scattered throughout the property, snorkeling, jumping off various rocks and using the wonderful pool.  Whilst large the resort is easy to navigate and the signage for where you can enter the water is well mapped out.  \nThe ocean is not too rough at Rockhouse compared to some other places we visited along the cliffs.  We also saw dolphins every night which was very cool!\nThe swimming pool is lovely, not many loungers around the pool but ample supply on the adjacent sun deck.  Pool service from the staff working at the bar was sensational, they did such a great job and were so prompt with taking your order, cleaning up etc.\n\nRESTAURANTS:\nWe tried both Rockhouse and Pushcart for dinner which was nice at both - yet on the pricier side.  Breakfast at Rockhouse each morning was delicious and reasonably priced (except fresh juices which were similar price to a cocktail!?)\nPool bar was great for drinks and a small menu for lunch/snacks.  Happy hour was 5pm until sunset and great value.  \n\nLOCATION:\nGreat location on the west end.  Next door to Rockhouse is a small mini mart which I used to buy water and some other shelf grocery items.\nIf you're eager, it is a short route taxi ride to other west-end highlights like Rick's Cafe etc in one direction or the main town in the other direction.  Route taxis very easy to catch from the front of property.\n\nOverall we had a wonderful stay.  The room we chose was cheap so I can't complain about it too much, but would definitely upgrade to a different room for a longer stay,\n\n",

To my disappointment, they gave us Villa #1 which was the villa directly across from the home with a barking dog which ran along the main road.  After reading several reviews prior to check in, I was fully aware which villas were along the main road and this villa in particular had complaints about a barking dog. I was very upset that they had ignored my request. I even told the front desk there is a barking dog and the bell hop said, \"There is no barking dog, ma'am.\" Obviously, that was a flat out lie. This dog was a night guard dog and whenever it saw something, it would bark. This made it very difficult to get decent rest. If you are in Villas 1 - 4... you will witness this yourselves. For the price you are paying, my expectations is to able to rest comfortably. For this reason, I am rating a 2 star. The property itself is lovely, but if you cannot guarantee which room you are in, I would just visit the property rather than staying there. ",

The food was awful except the buffet. some of the staff was really nice and some act like we owed them something. my girlfriends and i wanted to relax but kept getting bothered by ppl wanting to sell us things.\n\nmy biggest complaint is diamond members are in the back part of the hotel away from the main part of the hotel and the walk is a distance the hotel does not offer caddy rides after 11pm",

                  "text": "I am a returning resident havent been home in years so i was looking forward to coming to Negril the last time i was here i was in my teens . I took 2 flights to get here and the drive took a while felt like 2hrs so i highly recommend unless you love sitting on a bus waiting for people then use a private taxi i used Top choice Jamaica tours and i can say i was impressed with the service and consistency from online response to drivers i never expected it from local drivers its been a while for me . Anyways lets talk about the resort it looks great and i have no issues with the local staff . I do have an issue with the towels and i believe better management to oversea them might be really needed  I was there 6 nights and 3 days by 11am they were gone . I didn't get any oxtail that was very disappointing because thats what i came thinking i would get .  Jamaicans love oxtail please fix this . The drinks were okay entertainment people worked extremely hard . I did learn a few dance moves to bring back to home . I would say the beaches were clean not over spectacular . I would have prefer more local beats being played i beleive people coming here dont want to hear the same songs there use to . Im a coffe guy and the coffee was good . Jerk chicken was okay but the one at best in the west was so much better . I saw 2 weddings and they seem happy . My room was big clean and i had an ocean view . It did rain a bunch but i still had fun with my crew . I would say its not perfect and maybe i was expecting alot more maybe it was this time . I would come back to see if the food options are better but overall theres nothing here to say oh they ruin my vacation . The staff work hard ill say it again managment where are you and i will leave it just at that . PS Yanique is a great worker .",

                  "text": "\nWe are a returning couple and we really \"got the band back together\" by going again!\n\nThe Staff will get a kick out of reading this!\n\nThere is simply no place on the planet that provides the most welcoming folks, a top 5 world class beach as well as the most beautiful lush jungles and byways along with water that to me, is unmatched in beauty and safety as close to where I live near Annapolis, period!\n\nYou guys rock!\n\nOur return to Sunset at the Palms was a Story of “Getting the Band Back Together”!\n\nIt was so cool to see so many friends from our previous visit 6 years ago! The Club Mobay(pro tip-buy their airport service if you don't have it) met us at the Gate with a sign & a smile and walked us past the 2+ hour-Disney lines to a reserved Customs agent who got us through in 4 minutes flat.\n\nthen to the Mobay lounge for a nice lunch & private bathrooms to clean up,\nOmar at the car service who met us at the airport entrance with a sign remembered us from the last trip.\n\nShinnel who I met as my assigned concierge in ’17 and became “best of friends” was there to greet us again. Her, Chenil and Alexandra all are very good at making you feel special because they all have warm hearts.\n\nEric the insane-driving taxi driver was found hanging around on the road next the resort in a brand new minivan! We hired him again and he even drives sane now-progress! Much laughter and much fun!\n\nThey told us Sinclair the “knowledgeable taxi driver” doing the YS Falls trips was still there,\n\nKevon our Sunset beach guy was still there and even Henry the free lance boat operator who we hired before was still there!\n\nThere was Piano Paul, an elderly man in ’17 but a personable entertainer, I had feared covid may have got him. I was thrilled to recognize his playing as we were eating dinner in one of the restaurants!\n\nThey had assigned us a tree house with screens since I forgot to mention I NEED glass windows b/c of difficulty in high humidity ….my sweetheart was on it with a call to Shinnel to get us switched…and they put us back in #702 where we stayed in ’17.\n\nKnow this before you go, they are VERY accommodating. \n\nThey even have a day pass available for a guests if you already have a friend on the Island.\n\nIt really was “getting the band back together”.\n\nWe met the new manager Romeo McIntyre (’19) who had a Returnees dinner for us and the other guests on the beach, big fire, great time. He has done a fine job of letting the folks who know how to treat their guests, do their jobs. We found no change in the level of service b/c most of the folks that worked there before, are still there!\n\nFOOD- Huge improvement over last time! GREAT JOB Romeo! The fruit was better and the the quality of the food top to bottom was much better. I may have lost weight on that last trip but didn't this time!\nWell done guys!\n\nWhile 2 years of being empty certainly hurt the tropical landscape, they have obviously been working hard to restore it. The buildings also are 6 yrs in the jungle, older but still nice and cool. Imagine eating outdoors in an open but covered restaurant with fans in the middle of a lush jungle….zero bugs!\n\nThere was a reason that we returned when we could have chosen to go anywhere..................it's really that nice!\n\nHey Kerry, can I talk about Dash?\n\nSpecial K",

Just stayed here again as a repeat guest and it blew us away. Food was amazing (and we are foodies).  Beach was one of the best in Negril. But we really came here for the staff and other guest.  Staff makes you feel at home.  From the General Manager, to concierges, bar and food staff weee excellent. Most of the other guest are there for the same reasons we love this place and everyone just mixes in well together. Will never stay any where else (unless we have to bring the kids next time)!",

But from the time we arrived to the min we stepped back on the bus to leave , our every need was met. There was 12 of us . So yes this resort is laid back not a party resort ,so we made our own party. Shinnel was our Concierge and she made are stay awesome. Along with all the other waitresses ,waiters and bartenders. Odine was probably our favorite. If you have something you need and they don't have it they can get it for you. Buffet was great. And we liked both lotus leaf and chefs showcase. The beach is short walk away and beach bar food was awesome. The staff is the reason for a 5 star. They made our trip one of the best.",

The beach is great and the water is beautiful. This resort has a quiet vibe which is super chill and if that is what you are looking for is perfect.  Food was good and the beach service was really nice. They have a beach bar and food where they will serve you right at your cabana. The bathrooms at the beach are also super nice.  The staff is friendly, attentive, funny and just overall the best I have encountered at an all inclusive. The martini bar is spot on and they will make you a really amazing martini of any variety.  The pool and pool bar is open until 1:00am if you feel like a late night swim but the beach closes at 7:00pm. You do have to cross a road for the beach but they have  a crossing guard and the beach is nice. You can see other resorts on the beach and they are so much more crowded- I felt like we had our own private beach. \nGo here is you are looking for relaxing chill vibe with a beautiful quiet beach.",

                  "text": "Overall a very relaxing unplugged trip. Supports the use of less devices and more submerged in nature. Your subconscious gets a break from constant screens to always hearing birds or crickets as your background. Each room is a tree house with its own bedroom, balcony and bathroom. The downside is the AC unit isn't as strong so during the hottest parts of day it's still a bit warm in the room prob between 1pm-4pm. Most ppl don't use their room at that time but if you do, it's something to note. It would have been fine for us except I am pregnant and always extremely hot so needed full blast AC. We made it work by utilizing the gym during that time which had the best coolest AC on the hotel and then heading to the beach which we learned had the best breeze.\nThe bed matress was actually pretty good and gave support for a good night's rest.\n\nMy recommendation is to skip the pool and bar by the pool and head to the beach. The beach has the better lunch menu, it's own bar and service right to your beach chair all included with your stay.\nPros\nBeach was top notch. Clean white sand, calm and clear waters. The umbrellas/shade and chairs are included and you dont have to pay extra. You can also retrieve your new towels from the beach bar too. Lunch is open to 5pm which is very convenient. Downside. If you come from Caribbean decent you will be largely disappointed with the north American burgers, fries, wraps menu for lunch daily. The best thing is the jerk nachos and authentic fish sandwich which I really enjoyed. Breakfast is a mix of local and North American foods which was my fav daily. Dinner was mixed. Sometimes you may get a few jamacian local items and sometimes you may not. If you are looking for carribean food daily this isn't the place. They do jamacian dinners twice a week otherwsie it's mixed. \nPleasant surprises\nYou won't find much plastic which I liked. The water bottles you can't get away from and they are provided in your room. Otherwise the straws and mixing sticks for drinks are non plastic sustainable options which I truly appreciated. Everywhere is kept clean on the grounds including the private beach which is kept pristine. Plenty towels are provided. There are only 85 rooms so they personalize guest service and if you need anything, you can ask and they do their best to provide to you without a cost. I broke out in heat rash and they willingly found me fresh aloe to calm my skin. All the workers are friendly and don't ask or pressure you for tips.\nOverall final pros\nYou def leave more relaxed than you would expect\nTop tier beach\nTop tier service\nGorgeous Flora and fauna on the entire property which is itself an experience\nEverything is close to walk to\n\nOverall cons\nDon't go here if you are pregnant and need to be in AC a lot or if you are a foodie looking for more Caribbean food than mixed options\nBecause the beach is a 2 min walk from the property it's not within the same land which means the property is not breezey which is something I overlooked. Normally having a hotel on the beach means lots of breeze when you are sitting out longing at night or in the day having a drink in an outdoor bar",

                  "text": "My wife and I booked a week at Bahia Principe Grand as part of a package on Expedia, so we had no advance knowledge of the place. All we knew is that the photos looked great ... understanding that sometimes photos on a website don't always paint an accurate picture.\n\nIn this case, though, they did. We had high expectations for our week in Jamaica and because of the resort an staff at Bahia Principe Grand, our vacation still managed to exceed those expectations.\n\nThe all-inclusive resort is huge, but we never felt crowded. There are courtesy golf carts to take guests from the main lobby to the beach, restaurant and beach areas. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, the pool is huge and crystal clear, with swim up bars at either end and in addition to two buffet restaurants, there are also several specialty restaurants that require reservations.\n\nBut what sets the place apart is the service. It starts the minute you step into the lobby for check in when you're greeted with a complementary glass of rum punch. Everyone that works there, from the desk folks to the bellmen, waiters, waitresses, lifeguards and the bartenders who are very generous in their pours went out of their way to make sure we were happy and having a good time.\n\nAs for the food, the buffet in the main building and at the beach were decent with a wide variety of offerings. Breakfast was especially good, thanks to Kenroy, the guy who made our fresh omelets and made me smile with his great attitude every morning! But the real stars of the show were the specialty restaurants. We had steak dinner at the The Knife and Italian at Vida Dolce and both were excellent!\n\nIn addition to the pool and the beach, there was live music on the patio every night -- including a Bob Marley tribute and a steel drum band performance. And my wife got a massage at the full service spa for an extra fee ($99 for a 50-minute session).\n\nThe resort also offers a variety of excursions, including the outstanding day trip we booked to Nagril.  \n\nAll-in-all it was a relaxing, memorable, fun week at a more than reasonable price! It was so good that we plan on going back again next year!\n\n",

We loved the jerk chicken, made to order pasta and grilled fish and shrimps.\n-beach is clean, water is clear and very calm on the grand side.  Up to the roped area is probably 6 feet. Lots of beach chairs and shade.\n-hallways were not carpeted on villas on the left side facing the hotel, villas 14, 15 & 16. Villas 17 &18 were  closed and being renovated\n- beach restaurant is very near for lunch if you are at the beach and doesn’t want to go all the way to the Orquidea buffet for lunch\n-pool is huge! We didn’t use it though because we preferred the beach.\n-beautiful kids waterpark\n-drinks in the room were replenished everyday- water, beer, coke and juice\n\nCons:\n-lots of unfriendly staff. Guests seem to be invisible in this resort. Just a handful of staff will greet you.\n-don’t count on promises/words of staff at reception or guest services. We were told  3X we were getting champagne and chocolates for our anniversary but nothing came. When we followed up the second time, we were told it might be because we had the “ do not disturb” sign. After making sure that sign wasn’t placed on the door again and after 3rd follow up with the staff saying “it will be delivered before the night ends” still nothing. So don’t keep your hopes up. Very disappointed because we chose to celebrate our 35th anniversary here, spending more than what we usually do as a special celebration and there was no special treatment at all. \n-first room we were assigned was at villa 12. When we went in the ceiling was leaking and there was a pool of water on the floor. The hallway carpets seemed really old.\n-the pasta station was very popular, always a long line up. There was just one person doing everything in that station- cooking, washing the pots, refilling the ingredients. Attention Bahia management, please look into that!\n-sewage smell coming from drain in the shower. We kept it covered with a plastic bag filled with water when not in use. We were happy with our room and didn’t want to risk being moved to a worse room.\n-people were smoking weed in the beach area. \n-lots of flies, even landing on food. They have  big fans to try to keep them away.\n\nThis morning in front of the buffet, staff were urging guests to share their “happiness” and give reviews online. When I said I will share my review but there were some things that I wasn’t happy about, she replied “It’s all right, we can’t make everyone happy.” That’s exactly the attitude you will get from the staff in this resort. In my experiences in the Dominican Republic, Mexico and most specially in Cuba with all the shortages happening right now, I don’t feel as welcome here in Jamaica. \n",

Yes, I said relax and kids in the same sentence. Haha \nThis is the place! Everything/everyone was wonderful! \n\nThe Nanny service is amazing. We got a second one since we have two young children and and it was perfect. They were kind and caring with our girls. It felt very personal and I wasn’t just dropping off my kids at a daycare. They did what my kids wanted to do all day long. By the end of our trip (which we extended) our girls didn’t want to leave. We felt like family while we were there. \n\nThe rest of the staff is also amazing. The lifeguards are always alert and they get in the water and play with your kids! The servers, bartenders, chefs, and entertainment coordinators are wonderful too. \n\nThe food was delicious! We didn’t know what to expect at a kid friendly resort, but we were blown away. Fresh fish, local cuisine, but also French and Italian food. \n\nOur accommodations were very large,  comfortable, and cool (AC was exceptional). \n\nI enjoyed a scrub and a massage while I was there- also amazing! \nWe can’t wait to come back!!!! \n\n",

The reason we return year after year is because it is a true vacation for the entire family. There is an activity for everyone or nothing at all, depending on your preference. Our first trip was when my children were 8 months and 3 years old. We had two lovely nannies, one to stay with the baby while he took naps and the other to chase our 3-year-old around while she swam, played in the sand, and did arts and crafts. I was able to enjoy a pool side chair in the shade with a book; for a full-time mom this was true luxury. Now our children are 11 and 14 and our nanny this year was Patricia, she was perfect. Our 11-year-old is very active, Patricia made sure he participated in every beach football (soccer) game and cricket match.  Our 14-year-old is more independent and prefers to spend her vacation in the water, Patricia was always waiting with a towel when we finally dragged her to dry land.  \nA few things of note that I love about FDR. The suites are spacious and comfortable. \nThe resort has an overall laid-back attitude and feel, it doesn’t matter what you wear just that you are enjoying yourself. No dress code or reservations at the restaurants. \nThe resort is private and safe. As my children have gotten older and more independent, I feel completely comfortable with them navigating the property on their own. The way the resort is set up there is no public access so no one can wander in or out without passing staff/security.\nThe absolute best attribute of FDR is their staff, they are so friendly and welcoming. Chrisse and Lorna-Gay at the bar make the best drinks and smoothies. Shanille on the lifeguard/boat staff is always up for a snorkel or fishing trip on the boat. We have been to other resorts that “allow” children, but everyone at FDR ADORES children and will go above and beyond at every opportunity.    \nIf you are traveling to Jamaica with children FDR is the BEST! \n",

Let me tell you there's NOTHING like FDR. You wanna know why? Well there you go: You don't have to book the  restaurant to eat supper like in many other hotels. You don't need transportation to go to the beach, pool or anywhere. Everything is walking distance from the room.  The room is comfortable. You have a nanny (Cinthia we miss you!) for the day at NO EXTRA COST. They have a kid's club with many activities for the whole day. The food is absolutely delicious. Everywhere you step is clean. The employees are respectful, always smiling and ready to help you. FDR...we'll be back! And this time we are bringing friends with us. Thank you everybody for making our stay THE BEST EVER!\nFanny",

                  "text": "My husband and I visited Jamaica for the first time for our 10 year anniversary. ALL of the staff were absolutely wonderful. In fact everywhere we went we felt all of the people from Jamaica were so kind, welcoming, and hospitable. The resort has great food and the drinks are definitely not watered down! Sherene at one of the pool bars was our favorite bartender. Merric makes the best omelettes ever in the breakfast buffet. The lady who works in the coffee hut also makes great drinks and was very kind. \n\nFavorites:\n-The Platinum restaurant for the amazing view, great service, and good food\n-Oceanview room! Definitely upgrade, it’s so worth the view \n-Cabana rental on the beach with stellar butler service\n-Free water sports! Kayaking, paddle boarding, and catamaran rides\n-Booze Cruise booked directly from the resort with snorkeling! \n-Entertainment Team! The best! Thanks for teaching me how to play cricket and calling me out multiple times when I revert to the rules of baseball LOL so fun! Also loved yoga, water aerobics, and trivia!\n-Reading my book in the hammock by the ocean at sunset \n-The pizza!!! Omg I’m already craving it. Definitely order the Hawaiian pizza (not sure the actual name but it has chicken, pineapple, and some kind of magical mango sauce on the most delicious crust) ever)\n-My massage with Tanya in the spa \n-Book the Blue Hole excursion with River tubing. Unforgettable! \n-The water slide! It’s so fun, I mean who doesn’t love a water slide?? \n\nCons:\n\n-The beach is small. It’s big enough but you can’t go out far due to the roped off area as it is seaweed covered after the rope. You also can’t walk the beaches because it is completely closed off (although this does enhance safety I suppose) The beach I believe is man made so the sand is not what you will get if you go to Negril or Montego Bay Area. \n\n-Night time shows were ok but I was hoping for more of a Jamaican vibe. Things were advertised such as “Jamaican Street Party” which turned out to be just music playing and people sitting and drinking. More variety would be great.\n*** I will say we were so exhausted by 9pm that we didn’t always want to venture out anyways but I do think this is one area that could improve. I will also add however that we didn’t make it up to the night club so I can’t fully speak to the night time vibes. \n\nLast thing - I was disappointed when the water aerobics was replaced with a U.S Zumba teacher the last couple of days we were there. I was not a fan and much prefer the entertainment team who did a great job with water aerobics. \n\nWe had a fantastic vacation!! We would absolutely stay here again!",

                  "text": "This was our 3rd time at Jewel and again, our experience was top notch. Searh my profile for my reviews from our first 2 trips. \n\nFrom our spesific room request to the morning we checked out, we felt at home. We saw many familiar faces, staff who welcomed us home and we met some new faces/new friends. Like mentioned in my previous reviews, the staff at Jewel are the best and everyone goes above and beyond to make your vacation a memerable one. The service here is truly service from the heart.\n\nAirport transfer and excursions......reach out to Tomeik at Reggae Island Tours on FB and tell him Lee-Ann and Sam sent you!! I've known him for years and he's a great guy, dependable, accomodating and safe! \n\nThe Drinks!!! OK, I'll be honest. I go to drink/party/let loose. Everyone who pours here, pours great drinks! The Sunken Treasure Bar is my favorite and has the best bartenders. Drinks are NOT watered down and the cocktails are yummy, while I mostly stick to my favorite. You must try some rum cream. So good!!\n\nLike our first 2 visits, the food was great. I never had any trouble finding something yummy to eat and never went hungry. Chef Fredrick is THE MAN!!  And like everyone else, we can't say enough about Merric at the omlette station. Hubby brought his own scotch bonnets and Merric happily added them to his breakfast! \n\nThe pools are are all great but the main pool is my favorite. Jonoy...who not only kept the pool immaculate , is also a wonderful guy. He brought us to visit where our son's ashes are, at our former favorite resort, Jewel Runaway Bay. This meant the world to us!! Star employee, for sure!!  \n\nOur room was the one I requested...thank you Camille....and it was always clean and a/c was perfect. I find the bed extremely comfortable and woke up with zero backpain, like I do at home. \n\nThe beaches here are man-made but I have zero complaints there. The water is warm and calm and I love the marine life...esp. at the small snorkel beach. \n\nThe entertainment was fantatic, esp. The Silver Birds Steel Drum Band. Like on previous visits, it's one of my favorite nights, getting to see them perform.\n\nTake advantage of the activities here. The glass bottom boat ride is included. Ariel, who took us out,  is one of the new faces to us and a great addition to Jewel. There is also hobie cat rides, paddle boarding, kyaking, trivia, tennis, beer pong as well as other games, nature walks...and much more. \n\n A highlight for us is the grounds. We absolutely love walking around the resort, enjoying all the plants, flowers, and fruit trees. Shout out to Donovan and his team! \n\nAnother highlight for us is the sunset bar. Every evening before dinner, we enjoy our drinks up there, watching the sunset. Jewel sunsets are the best sunsets!! \n\nOne thing that was added since our previous trip was the Silent Heeadphone Party. I'd love it if Jewel coud do that 2x a week, as it was SO. MUCH. FUN. I love to dance on vacation and I found the silent headphone party was more happening than Bling, which can be hit ot miss. That said....Bling is great on Retro Night, when old school is played! \n\nSpeaking of music....this would be my one complaint. My prefect afternoon is hanging out in the main pool, hearing some of my favorite dancehall songs. I did request them played, even provided a list, lol. But I did not get to hear much of my classic dancehall songs. So when we return, I'll be bringing my bluetooth. Reggae is Jamaica's gift to the world but there is more to Reggae than Bob Marley. Just sayin'. \n\nWifi has definitly improved since our last visit which is appreciated! \n\nSecurity at Jewel is fantastic, for those who have that concern. You'll be safe here! Jamaica as a whole is a great and beautiful country and I know that with the current reavel advisories, people are scared but need not be!! The advisories are to do with very spesific areas, where you wouldn't be anywhere near. I have been to Jamaica 8 times and have NEVER felt unsafe. \n\nI'll close with once again mentioning the staff. Miss. Barbara ( GM ) and all the people who work at Jewel are the best in the business!! I've said it before, I'll say it again....you are treated like family at Jewel and we can not wait to return....hopefully in December!! \n\n",

We had breakfast at the buffet every day, something for everyone here from healthy choices like fresh fruit and different porridges to crispy bacon and omelets made fresh for you by Merrick. For lunch there are so many choices, we had something different each day.  No reservations needed for dinner except at the Japanese but we never had to wait too long for a table and the food was always great no matter where we ended up.\nThe resort's pools are so lovely and clean. We spend all of our days going from pool to pool, the all have unique features and great swim up bars. Shout out to Janice,  Tamique and TJ for keeping us hydrated!\nThe evening entertainment is great but for us, we enjoy a drink in the Sunset bar before we head up to the Piano bar at 9:00. Marlon runs the Piano bar and he is the star of the resort! One night he had 71 people in that little bar and he did not miss a beat. No one was kept waiting for there drinks and at the same time he is telling jokes, doing magic tricks and singing.  We look forward to seeing him every year. \nThis year our son and his girlfriend joined us on our trip and our son proposed while we were there! All of the staff were thrilled for us and helped us celebrate wherever we went.\nWe are already planning our next trip to this fabulous resort!",

                  "text": "We stayed at the Jewel from December 23-30 2019, and found ourselves asking “Really?”\n\nAfter doing extensive research, my wife had determined that based on reading many articles and reviews, the Jewel was going to be a sparkling gem, when in fact we felt as though it was a diamond in the rough.\n\nI have a few pros and cons that I will list, and hopefully it helps any would be readers\n\nPros-\n\n1. The Beach.\n\nThe beach was incredible, the sand was very fine, and spacious enough that you never felt crowded. The ocean was shallow well past the roped off swimming area. The water was crystal clear and full of many different kinds of fish that swim around the large rocks at the edge of the swimming area. Tip- Bring bread into the water to feed the fish, they will surround you and come right to the surface!\n\n2. The Staff.\n\nWhile most of the staff were friendly enough, there were a handful of staff that went above and beyond. The housekeeper Shandae was a lovely sweet girl who did beautiful towel art. The Lifeguards Cleon (Infinity pool), Iron Man (Main pool), and Ralph (Infinity pool) were awesome, we spent lots of time talking and getting to know the guys that were there keeping us safe!\nFinally, Michael the Bartender... please make an effort to seek him out and say hi, he is such a nice young man. He spent countless hours at the swim up bar talking to our 3 kids, playing catch from behind the bar, and serving us endless exceptional drinks! He truly made our vacation! BIG UP MICHAEL!!\n\n3. The food.\n\nThe food overall was decent.\n\nThe Moonstone grill was very good, serving Burgers, Wings, Wraps, and a variety of different grilled sausage.\n\nThe Coral Cafe buffet was fairly repetitive, albeit tasty. There was an International section, Jamaican section, fresh fruits and smoothies, breads/bagels/English muffins/croissants,cold meats and cheeses, eggs to order (Make sure to chat with egg boy, he is very knowledgeable), omelet bar, pasta bar, stir fry bar, salad bar,and desert/coffee/mimosa station\n\nThere are 5 a la carte restaurants,\n\nJade Samurai Teppanyaki/ Golden Sabre Sushi-\n\nI can only speak to the Jade Samurai, as it was the only one we ate at.\n\nIt’s the only restaurant that requires reservations, make sure to book them early as it books up very quickly, that being said the food and service are excellent!\n\nMoonstone (Italian)\nPlatinum (Caribbean)\n",

The one night the buffet was done in the court yard which was different but interesting.  I did enjoy the hibachi restaurant which i ended up doing twice but i had never gone before so it could skew my experience.  Again you are in the caribean and these experiences you shouldnt compare to the ones you would usually get back home if you want some grand experience go to Vegas or something.\nThe pools were nice, the larger deeper pool felt colder than the one overlooking the beach.  The waterpark looked fun but didnt enjoy as much since my daughter was still quite young and weary of things.  \nThe staff seemed quite friendly all around and i couldnt say they were rude ever  (remember if your rude or have some expections of acting superior youll get a ruder response treat everyone with respect and dont look for a fight just cuz)\nI enjoyed this trip alot and for a first time in Jamaica I was a great experience.",

Will recommend the pizza.\n\nEntertainment was fair but i have seen a lot better.\nThe live band on Saturday night was good the rest of the nights would only get a 4/10.\n\nThe resort is small in size so that is a plus if you want some quiet relaxing time. \nI will give the resort a 9/10 for the tranquility, the grounds were gorgeous. \nThe resort is not loud, so we appreciated that too.\n\nWill i come back? Most likely not. Will pay a little more for better food options and drink options and better entertainment.",

                  "text": "I traveled to Jamaica with my best friend. We stayed at the Jewel for 14 nights from 22nd Dec 21 - 5th Jan 22. \nSo lets start with the highlights of our stay.  The staff at this hotel are lovely. They are kind and very helpful. The room was spacious and cleaned daily. Fresh towels were provided on a daily basis. There are choices of restaurants to dine at during your stay and there is a great little place on the beach that does jerk pork at chicken at lunch time. There is also a Grill bar which offers cheeseburgers, fries, wraps, salads and nachos. This is open till 2am in the morning. On the beech you are provided with Kayaks, body boards, pedalos and  free glass bottom boat trips and other trips. These are all included with your all inclusive package. There are great shows at night, but due to Covid19 the nightclub was closed. There is a great spot on the beach where you can get smoothies made with fresh fruit. These were very tasty. The bar offers all of your expected brands of spirits and a great choice of cocktails.  The hotel has lots of hand sanitizers and they are doing a great job at keeping their guests safe. The gym is located down by the beach and is open 24/7. There are tennis courts which are also open 24/7. There is a little gift shop onsite and you can play pool or ping pong. There is also a water slide and lots of little hidden jacuzzies dotted about the complex. There is a lovely coffee shop on site which offers lots of varieties of coffees and they are all wonderful quality and again part of your all inclusive package.\n\nDownsides: The beach is man made and the sand is not white like most beaches I have been to in the Caribbean.  The sea is cornered off so the water only comes up to your chest. Not great if you like to swim. The breakfast buffet was disgusting and needs attention. We had to live on eggs on toast as the bacon was cold and burned and all other foods on offer  were of a poor quality. The staff at breakfast are attentive when you first arrive, but this only lasts if you continuously tip. I have a rule that I only tip on the 2nd week, this gives me time to establish the quality of the persons service before making tips. I think if they can sort out the breakfast then this hotel is pretty much perfect. The grounds are maintained beautifully and the staff are lovely. I would not hesitate to go back to this hotel and would recommend it to friends.  The Asian restaurant, Jamaican restaurant, Italian restaurant are all worth a visit. There are lots of choices of foods throughout the day and plenty of spaces to book into them. There are always lots of sun beds available and two main pools which always have space to sit by. They both have swim up pool bars and the staff are great. This hotel will not let you down. Don't take any notice of the moaning minis that write poor reviews about this hotel because they are wrong. My only piece of advice for the hotel would be to offer a full English breakfast option and ensure this is kept hot. But that's simply a personal preference and you as a guest may enjoy the foods on offer at breakfast time. So if you have booked your stay here, get on that plane and enjoy it. I had two weeks of pure relaxation and bliss.  Thank you for reading this review and if you have any questions simply ask.",

We stayed in one of the courtyard rooms. It was very loud at night from a bar that is in front of the resort. By midweek it either quieted down or we got used to it.

Within a 500-acre wilderness preserve, blue mountains, lush palm groves, pristine coastlines and shimmering turquoise waters create an unbelievable backdrop for a monumental resort.

                  "text": "We had an amazing trip to Sandals South Coast. They were renovating one section of the resort, but they were very considerate regarding the construction noise which is unavoidable if you want to visit updated resorts. The resort is so large and spread out that it wasn’t noticeable at all  unless you were sitting right in front of that section. We stayed in the South Seas Swim-Up Rondoval with Private Pool and it was a phenomenal room. Of course it’s warm in Jamaica, and I like my air conditioning set to meat locker status (meaning I like it very cold)  which wasn’t possible in that room. The ceiling fan made a significant difference in the bedroom area, but it was a little too warm in the vanity area when trying to get ready for dinner in the late afternoon. We requested a floor fan to move some of the air to that area, and it made a HUGE difference. The 2 miles of private beach is absolutely beautiful, but there is some sea grass; so I spent more time looking at the ocean but didn’t like to get in the water much. \nThe Rondovals are very private, intimate, and a quiet setting. We LOVED the room. The only recommendations I could make to Sandals would be …\n1) allow the air conditioning to get colder overall in the room, \n2) put an air vent in the water closet (it was pretty warm in there with no air circulation)\n3) put some type of fan to move air around to the vanity area.\nWe loved being able to just step right out of our bedroom and into the pool. We would’ve loved to open the doors to the pool more, but couldn’t because the air conditioning couldn’t have handled cooling the room back off if we did. \n\nI’m not one that usually writes a review, but the main reason I wanted to leave this review is because of the absolutely phenomenal level of service we received the entire length of our stay. Our butlers, Kevin & Tevar, were complete rock stars!!! I cannot say enough about what a phenomenal job they both did. Everything from surprise decorations, to having a bubble bath with petals ready after a long day, to picking us up for dinner daily, to retrieving something from the room we forgot to bring to the beach with us, to bringing us food multiple times a day, to changing our dinner plans at the drop of a hat, to special snacks in our room, and the list goes on and on. They were top notch, and I can’t stress enough how much more special I felt because of their actions! It truly was like they were mind readers because when I would call to possibly request something, they would already be on their way with whatever I was just calling to ask about or it would already be in our room waiting for us before I could even think to call. I want to go back ASAP and stay in the Rondovals so we can have them again. I cannot think of one thing either of them could’ve done any better than what they did. \nThe other resort staff were amazing as well. Next time I will try to do a better job of jotting down names so I can specifically mention them, but everyone from the lovely lady who would make sure our drinks were topped off while in our beach chair, to the wonderful woman in the gift shop who was about to hunt me down before our bus departed, to the entertainment staff, and all of the servers were so friendly and helpful. I just don’t know that you can get any better service than what you get at Sandals South Coast!\nThe nightly entertainment was great, with the silent disco parties being our absolute favorite.",

She kept telling us to just relax and enjoy and that she was there to ensure that we were all having a great time.  Our other kudos for this Sandals staff was Kemo Sabe! He was one of our activities directors. His amazing energy was just what we needed!!! These 2 staff members had such wonderful & positive vibes and made us smile the entire week we were there! And let's not forget Jay...our bellhop. What a great way to be greeted as he walked us to our room on the top floor. His sense of humor was the best!!! He even checked in on us in middle of the stay and made sure we were all loaded up on our private shuttle back to the airpot. \n We loved this resort and hope to visit this beautiful place again one day!!!",

                  "text": "This was our second time to the resort. We absolutely love the environment, the customer service, the all around experience. However, we paid for a swim up room that was renovated less than two years ago, and it did not say luxury. There were numerous water spots on walls/ceilings, patches on walls could be seen everywhere, and in general had a poorly finished appearance. The swim up pool was the same with the appearance showing a real rush job, and the water level wasn’t high enough for the filters to keep dead bugs out, so pool was littered with them. I guess I’m pretty disappointed as I thought what I paid for would show better than it did. However, like I said, and we’ve been to the resorts for three visits, their customer service and the experience they provide is hands down the absolute best around! We wouldn’t continue to book future trips if they weren’t!! ",

Intricate blue tile work and jade chaise lounges offset the striking white retro architecture. Luxurious rooms boast private ocean-breeze balconies. Whether being pampered in the Zen-inspired spa—recognized as \"Best in the Caribbean\" by Travel+Leisure—sipping cocktails at the piano bar or indulging in an exquisite meal alfresco, Couples Tower Isle creates countless intimate moments that inspire you to return again and again.",

They sent 3 different people to fix it. It never got fixed. I had to leave a review online before they would switch rooms or do anything further about it. And going back to the promotion, they said at the end of the trip that we didn’t get the promotion and that we have to pay for the credit that we had on our account. Which I called and confirmed that we were using our 100 dollar credit. We had 97.30 on the room charge and stayed under the 100 dollar limit to maximize the promotion. As we are leaving literally getting on the bus, they tell us that it’s not covered and we had a different promotion. Not to mention that most of the waiters don’t actually have a clue when it comes to food allergies. We finally found two that were AMAZING however it was only two out of a staff of a few hundred",

I had been told about CTI's staff and how wonderful they were.  This was overall not the case.  It seems like there may have been turnover since they had been.  While it's true,  some are great, many seemed bothered by the fact if you needed them for anything.  Staff was on their cell phones quite often.   It was like an act of congress to just get a clean wash cloth in your room, which I find extremely off putting.\n\nGood:\nNice, older hotel\nNice reception\nEnjoyed the included excursions\nNot having to play the \"chair game\" at the beach.\nSome of the food- Bayside and 8 Rivers\nPrivate Beach (even though small and nothing spectacular)\n\nNot so good:\nFood was nowhere near up to par that we had been told of.\nMany staff wasn't interested in helping unless you \"extra\" tipped.\nBeach was small and kind of eh.  \nEntertainment needs to be revamped.\n\nIf you are looking for a nice beach, I highly recommend going elsewhere.\n\nJamaica Tip:  Get Club Mobay for arrival, especially if you've never been to Jamaica before or are arriving on a busy day.  Departure isn't needed (even though we had it).\n",

                  "text": "Cooled face towels and a glass of champagne to sip on arrival-nice! Check in staff wasn't overly friendly but they weren't rude either, just seemed indifferent to our being there. Our room was clean and spacious with plenty of places to hang clothing and tuck away luggage. Lush greenery prevented a full view of the sea but no issue with that as I feel the plant life added to the beauty of the resort. The hot water in the shower took a few days for me to figure out so it was cold showers for a few. \nThe grounds are breathtakingly beautiful. Resort never felt crowded and it felt as though many areas that we ventured to were ours alone. Entertainment on different nights was fantastic though I found the \"Gala\" night just wasn't our cup of tea. Activities staff is phenomenal, they seem to enjoy their work and make sure everyone who wants to be is included. Bartenders were fun, conversational and quick to pour a drink. Food was good, better at the restaurants you make reservations for. The coffee was delicious! If you've never had someone sing while they made you an omelet you'll get to experience that every morning in the buffet line! Awoken daily as soon as the sun began to rise by a rooster and I had wished he would have moved to another area once in a while ...but at least I was up to see the beautiful sunrise because of it. I'm sensitive to sounds and there was some type of machine beeping loudly for days behind Bella Vista that was bothersome as it was non stop. Another guest brought it to the attention of staff and it stopped for a while but started up again shortly after. This is one thing I do wish had been corrected as it did detract from the calming experience the resort otherwise provided. There was a violinist and a saxophone player who both roamed the grounds playing music at breakfast or dinner time which was lovely. Our housekeeper was wonderful and always made sure we had plenty of towels and turn down service was provided daily. Our mini fridge would get stocked when we put a card out to replenish beverages, and the room service staff was superb. We scheduled a private dinner at the wedding gazebo but there was some confusion on our part as to when we should arrive and so our photographer wasn't able to get really good photos of us before the sun set so that was disappointing. There were also a lot of flying bugs during the dinner landing on our table, us and the food (they do try to keep them away with tons of candles but it just didn't work) and it was too dark to see our food so we kind of hurried through it. It was our first time there and we didn't know what to expect but next time we will make sure to have plenty of time before dark to get photo's done and eat. Our waiter was wonderful though and he made sure music was playing while we ate and our glasses were never empty.\nWe never felt the need to leave the resort because they offer so much to do while you're there. The water activities are included and so my husband snorkled as I watched from the glass bottom boat, we took a spin on some water bikes and went on a catamaran ride with a helpful staff member. We met so many friendly people there (both staff and guests) and it really felt like a home away from home...with way better scenery. It was a very relaxed kind of fun so if you're looking for a party scene type of place this isn't it-it was perfect for us though. There is another business next to the main beach where loud music plays for a few hours during the day so that kind of takes away from the atmosphere on the resort for a bit but it's not something you can't escape -we just headed to the upper portion of the the resort and meandered through the stone pathways while sipping on coconut water served in a freshly cut coconut. I could go on and on about all of the reasons we overall loved it here and can't wait to go back but I think I've given a pretty good idea of our experience here. There are lots of little surprises around the resort (like the bird who said hello to me as I walked down a path) but I'll let you discover the rest on your own.",

Never had an issue with anything.  From the bed, pillows, tv, air conditioner, hot water, water pressure, toilet flushing, liqour supply, no compliantes.\n\nThe food was excellent at all the restaurants. Cassanova's renovations were off the chain. The open kitchen design is very welcoming to guest. Breakfast at Palizzini was a great way to start your day. Very relaxing and stress free. The Belle Vista, which is the Asian restaurant at night, was very good.\n\nThe entertainment was fantastic as usual.  The new patio, where the old pool was on top, has very nice furniture to sit and watch the nightly showtime.  The Ballon Bar is now air conditioned. A welcomed reno.  \n\nFinally, all the staff were very accomadating and greeted you with a smile. If they ran out of something, they went to get it quickly. Shout out to McQ, Andre, Herde and Nicoy for helping make our stay more enjoyable.\n\nSteve & Victoria\n",

Get a tour guide to help you navigate through the pools and to the giant staircase waterfalls—if the going gets too tough, there are points at which you can give up and walk along the adjacent path.\n\nThe falls are a popular stop for cruise boats that pass through the area, so if you’re planning on visiting on your own, you’ll want to get there early in the morning for fewer crowds. Afterward, cross the highway and dry off on the golden sand at Dunn’s River Beach. \n\n– Tripadvisor",

The guide Gibbs that was with us the whole time was very friendly and helpful. The tour was in a group of about 15 people that all went up the falls together in a group; we were not forced to hold hands which I was pleased about. The tour includes many photo opportunities as well as other fun things to do like jump into some pools in the falls. The site around the actual falls is very touristy and expensive so I would suggest skipping over it and just going to the actual falls and then back out again. Overall, if you want to climb up a waterfall, then Dunn's River Falls and Park is the perfect place to go; the trip up is fun as well as scenic and the guide is great.",

In the end we decided not to stay as we were pretty sure it wasn't the experience we were hoping for...and at the high price of admission it wasn't worth it to find out.\n\nI'm guessing if we arrived at opening time on a weekday we would have stayed (but probably only for a short time) because it would have been less crowded.\n\nAnother day (a weekday morning) we ended up going to YS Falls and loved it.",

He was very informative and very entertaining.\n\nThe resort was beautiful. The view of the mountains and the ocean was amazing. All the amenties were excellent. Lots to do on the resort. Food choices and variety was good. We especially enjoyed the Jerk Hut. And those Juicy patties are unforgettable. \nOur favorite drink was the \"Bob Marley\".\n\nWe had an amazing time. But what made the resort extraordinary was the staff. Diamond concierge staff was very helpful and patient. A huge thanks to Renee, Keisha, Marvin and Andre. \n\nA big hug and gratitude to Sabrina, Marco and Nikki. They made sure we were well taken care of. First time to Jamaica, but will not be our last. We felt at home and everyone made us feel like family. ",

                  "text": "Overall, Palace Resorts is generally a positive experience.  Our family of four has often frequented Palace Resorts over the years (3 times in last five years alone).  This, however, was our first time visiting Moon Palace Jamaica.\nThe facilities were well kept overall.  Likely not a fair comparison, but the food at Moon Palace Grande in Mexico was definitely better.   I preferred the pools and beach in Jamaica to most other lo in Mexico.\nExcept for a handful of bright spots, the attitude of the staff in Jamaica overall was not particularly pleasant.  We were often treated like we were a bother.  One staff member observed a less than positive interaction we had with another staff member and encouraged me to give management feedback saying, “…people forget you are the reason we are here…there’s no way I would put up with that if I were you.”  Hospitality and a service-focused attitude is not the standard overall.\nAlso, fair warning, those depending on transportation to and from the airport, please be wary and prepared to find your own taxi from Moon Palace Jamaica to Montego Bay.  Our family of four was assigned a 5:00pm departure on our last day and provided written guidance to arrive at 4:45pm.  We did this coordination 48 hours in advance as required and I double checked our departure time in-person with two members of the transportation staff the morning of.  The employees confirmed our departure was indeed for the 5:00pm shuttle.  We arrived in the lobby even earlier than required at 4:20pm, but it turned out the final shuttle of the day was at 4:00pm.  For my part, I did make the mistake of providing an inaccurate flight time of 10:30pm vs. 9:00pm (the same flight departs later on the following day and I pulled up the wrong flight info when coordinating travel in advance), but this did not change when the last airport shuttle departed the day of our departure).  Rodrigo Patrón Bravo, the manager in charge of travel at the resort, refused to have the resort take responsibility for assigning our family to a non-existent shuttle and refused to provide transportation to the airport ($160) and even suggested that if we didn’t pay, the two employees that double checked and  confirmed our departure time the morning of could be held financially responsible for the mistake.  I sincerely hope Mr. Patron Bravo’s approach does not represent how Palace Resorts management treats their employees behind the scenes.\nPalace has been our “go to” when seeking an all-inclusive resort or recommending a resort to others for years.  We have many family memories where a Palace Resort has been the backdrop.  Given this experience, we will have to look elsewhere in the future and advise others of this situation.  Had Mr. Patron Bravo simply made the right decision, I would instead be here singing his praises and congratulating Palace Resorts on a job well-done within an unfortunate situation.",

Very fun to talk to and would made sure you had everything you needed, including grabbing lunch, ( the jerk chicken...yum) and bringing it to you so you never had to leave the beach.  Eli at the hibachi grill was fantastic.  The food he made was delicious, and was very careful to not cross contaminate shell fish, as my husband is allergic.  A/c worked super well, our room was cold all the time which felt great after being in the hot sun all day.  Pools were cleaned and well kept, and grounds were beautifully manicured.  If you up for an adventure, we highly recommend the Dunns Falls hike.  As the awesome guys at the kayak to help you with transportation. It is a bit challenging, so make sure to take water shoes and be in half way decent shape.  \nThe only thing we did not care for was the size of the bathroom, it was tight and cramped, but everything else was spot on perfect\n",

                  "text": "The only thing these people care about is chasing down guests to get them to return, buy their membership—non-stop harassement bait and switch style.  Roaches in a room, couples were  assigned two double beds and asked to upgrade and pay more in order to have the bed size they paid for. If you have any dietary requirements you might as well go back now because you’ll be fasting or having a miserable vacation. How about waiting for six hours to be checked in then be assigned an already occupied room.\nUnfortunately this resort has wasted potential clearly from poor management.  The grounds are nice and staff can clearly be trained, but…there is no leadership or vision to do so.  Wait staff is very good but it is quite obvious they try to appear happy just so they could get tips. Many don’t even bother. Front desk staff is the worst, they are not even attempting to convey anything but a negative attitude or making the guest feel like they bother them or that any request is a  big deal. \nFood is OK at the buffet, but pretty much the same every day, almost no variation. Italian restaurant is horrible, ordered two basic Italian items which we could not eat: minestrone soup aka veggie brother with some party and raw cubes of zucchini and soupy risotto with absolutely no taste! We ended up leaving for the buffet just so we don’t go to bed hungry.",

                  "text": "We’ve been back from our Sandals Ochi vacation for a week now, and we’re ready to go back.  Would 150% recommend!  We stayed 2 nights in a butler level room with a semi private pool, and we spent 3 nights in a Romeo and Juliet suite.  Donovan, Akeem, and Dewayne were our butlers.  They took such good care of us.  I’m not exactly sure what Dewayne’s role was (possibly a butler in training?) but he was so sweet and accommodating.  Actually, the entire staff is super friendly.  Special shout out to Dontae who wasn’t our butler, but he kindly gave us a ride up the hill to our room when Donovan was tied up on the beach side.  The private dinner on the beach is a must.  I would also recommend Dino’s Pizza and the Jerk Shack.  I’d read some negative reviews about the Italian restaurant before we traveled, but our experience there was excellent!  We never felt crowded at the resort.  Never had a problem getting chairs by the pool.  The only downside was the heat and humidity, but that is to be expected when traveling to the Caribbean in June.  So, we spent most of our time in the water.  The beaches and sunsets were gorgeous!  We had a few issues with our pool in the Romeo and Juliet suite.  The light and the filter in the pool did not work.  The jets in the hot tub did not work.  We notified our butlers, and they immediately sent engineers to do the necessary repairs.  Unfortunately, it didn’t get fixed during our stay.  We just chalked it up to “first world problems” and continued to enjoy our vacation.  Before we left, we rebooked a stay at Sandals South Coast for next year.  If you are even considering returning to Sandals, definitely book again during your stay.  The savings are huge!",

If anyone is looking for something to do I suggest that. Food and room service was amazing. We book another trip through sandal beaches before we ever left due to the people.

We are in room #10 which is a small studio but it has everything you need. The refrigerator could use updating but only for aesthetics, it works fine. It’s perfect for two people. The room has so much light and lots of windows that you can open and get a nice breeze from the ocean along with two skylights, one over the bed and one in the bathroom. One thing I am impressed with is the electrical outlets, there must be 20 outlets in this room, along with the phone charging ports. I can’t wait to come back.",

Furthermore, please accept our sincere apologies for not meeting your expectations regarding the room you requested. We do try to honor these requests; however, there are times when we do not have the room unoccupied and available. We do understand your frustration, and we genuinely regret disappointing you. We regret the lack of attentiveness you encountered at our front desk for any housekeeping issues with your room. We know a first impression is essential, and what you’ve experienced is not typical. We are committed to providing a comfortable stay with exceptional service; therefore, we hope to have an opportunity to better your experience whenever your travels bring you back to the area.\n\nKind regards,\nClark Guinn\nGeneral Manager\n",

The hot tub in the room when turned on mold came from the jets.  While earring chicken curry a paper towel was cook in with my food.  The only correction to any of the above mentioned problems was a simple sorry and have a good day.  My family took over 30 members to this resort and the vast majority had a terrible experience and would never stay it this resort again",

It is amazing what the performers are able to do.  The watersports were a highlight.  We had a great time snorkeling with Baba (we went twice and he made sure to bring us to 2 different spots). When everyone else saw a turtle but my son was on the other side, her personally brought him over and pointed it out as it was swimming away. He really cared about making sure everyone had a good experience. We also did paddleboarding (saw giant starfish), banana boat- very fun, and the glass bottom boat.  For the boat and snorkel we got there at 8am to sign up for the next day but I don't know if that was necessary. Sean was really helpful too with the sports.  Almost every staff person we encountered seemed happy to be there- this included housecleaning who were very friendly.  The ocean water is crazy warm.  Th crepe place was one of our favorites.  Yaku and Kimonos are must do's.  Reserve dinner when you 1st arrive.\nCons: After paying a lot of $ for this vacation I wasn't expecting to have to pay more for a spot on the beach.  It was a rude awakening to find out that we couldn't sit in a cabana or any other covered spot in the front row of the beach without paying money to reserve it. This made us feel like 2nd class citizens.  Almost every day someone came by and asked us how we were enjoying our stay and when I mentioned the cabanas and other butler reserved spots, they had no response. They were sure to write down our room # b/c my guess is they had a quota of how many guests they needed to check in with.  Essentially this let us know that they didn't really care about our feedback or experience-- they just wanted to get credit for having talked to us.  And we almost never tried to sit at the pool b/c those also seemed to be reserved by butlers or people who staked out their spot before 8am.  There just isn't enough space or chairs around the pool.  The kid activities were listed but we only saw 1 in action for kids over 10.  We went to both baseball and soccer and nothing was happening, no staff showed up. This meant that our 12 yr old was mostly stuck with his boring parents all week.  Overall it is a beautiful place and the staff was great; the cons are things that seem easily remedied, if they want to...",

Our experience was unsurpassed by any other vacation.  Our breakfast server at the Mill was Navina.  She quickly knew our beverage orders and got them to us immediately.  She was friendly and extremely attentive.  The restaurants were very good.  Chef Leon at Mariachi prepared a delicious dinner for us and checked in on us to be sure that we were pleased.  My wife and daughter had spa services and the staff was extremely professional. A shout out to Hopal and Kareena for their attentiveness! The absolute highlight of our trip was the water sports! The entire water sport team was outstanding.  Rosemarie and Janique were quick to retrieve our gear and knew our sizes. They were very accommodating when scheduling our snorkel trips. Having said that, the reputation of the water sports rests on the shoulders of Jullian, Creton aka Bubba, and Raj.  They were amazing! They were fun, knowledgeable and felt like friends and family.  Because they were so much fun, we snorkeled 7 times on our trip including a private charter to the caves! Our trip could have been great but these fellows elevated our vacation to UNBELIEVABLE! If they saw us around the property they addressed us by name and were particularly wonderful to our 2 children! Diving down and bringing up shells and sea  life was an experience my children will never forget! We look forward to returning and doing it all over!",

We had a few minor glitches on check-in but nothing that wasn't immediately tended to.  The grounds were absolutely beautiful and well maintained.  Our room was a perfect size for my husband and I \n but the same room was a little tight for my son and his family of 4.  The beds were double not queen so it was a tight fit.  The restaurants were good.  We wish there were a few more to choose from but having said that, Chef Leon from the Mariachi Restaurant prepared a fabulous meal.  Stew Fish was really good too!  Allison at the front desk was extremely helpful.  At the main pool bar was bartender Leon.  He worked so hard but always attentive to the guests and made great drinks! Now I am saving the best for last...the Water Sports team.  There are not enough words to express how fantastic they are.  Starting with Rosemarie and Janique at the hut making sure that everything was good with us and figured out very quickly what size fins and we wore and made sure our grandson got the exact fins he wore everyday!  Next we come to the captains and mates on the boats.  Jullian, Creton aka Bubba, and Raj are phenomenal!!  They are so fun and so knowledgeable about the water and the snorkeling!  We snorkeled with them everyday and sometimes twice!  They looked out for my grandchildren while snorkeling and my husband and I as well.  Seeing them so much, they felt like family to us.  We even chartered the snorkel boat for a few hours to sail down the beach and around to point to snorkel in the caves and go to Rick's Cafe to watch folks diving from the rocks.  We have been to other all inclusives where some had some water sports included ( but most did not)  but we have never had an experience like we had here at Beaches Negril.  Jullian, Bubba, and Raj turned our vacation from great to \"Off the Chart\" fabulous.  We already miss them and we just arrived home last night!",

Sheets,towels caused my skin to itch so bad,I could not sleep !\nLike I said ,if you like comfort and somewhere you can sleep well go ahead and take my stupid idea and book somewhere else .",

You cannot take the hotel at face value, you have to see its potential.  From reading the reviews and visiting the hotel I knew they would be able to produce the experience we desired for such a special day.\n\nI live in the UK and therefore was anxious, however, the customer service and professional, friendly and warm encounters with the Wedding Planners gave me peace of mind.  I am a control freak and naturally it is difficult to be trusting.  I manage a large team and always feel the need to be in control.  Despite my constant calls and emails they maintained there ability to assure me.\n\nThe package and pricing was perfect for what they delivered.  Trust me if there ever is a time to get married, small and intimate (and at the Mandeville Hotel) is the way to go.  However at the Mandeville Hotel they went above and beyond to make our special day outstanding.\n\nWe had clean and comfortable beds.  Our room was charming and relaxing.  Nothing beats a good shower neither and I was not disappointed at all.  Reception welcome and responses was perfect, breakfast was superb (I love a Jamaican Breakfast) and the customer service was perfect.  I really had no complaints.\n\nThe wedding setting, decor and servicing was perfect.  I had a vision of how everything was going to be, but Tanielle (My wedding planner) and her team blew my mind and those who know me, know how difficult that can be.  The food, the cake, the DJ and the atmosphere has made it all a memory that I reflect on everyday since 26th September 2020.  I would not change a thing.\n\nI want to say a big thank you (with tears of gratitude) for making my dream come true and our wedding oh so special.  Thank you for bearing and being patient with me.  Thank you for making the stay oh soooo sweet.  Thank you.",

When I spoke with her via telephone, Coleen made me feel at ease even though I was worried.  She is the face of the hotel. Rodian is polite and helpful; we had some good laughs. Zenga is the best, very professional, helpful, and friendly.  He is very trustworthy. The food was excellent, like no other in Mandeville or even at most all-inclusive hotels. Customer service was exceptional. Miss Gurnett, the housekeeping lady, was excellent. I would stay at this hotel only because of the staff and the food. Everyone was friendly. I felt at home and ease. Thanks to the Chefs!!!! Nuff respect.\nTo the management, in this era, it's tough to produce competent workers with excellent customer service. You have a team of what I call the dream team of Coleen, Rodian, and Zenga, they are the face of your business, and they make you look good. Please take care of them, let them know they are appreciated. Workers like your dream team are scarce in the hospitality industry. The building needs a lot of updating, too outdated. We are in the 21st century. You can do a lot more and still keep it rustic authentic if that's what you are aspiring to reach. Lots of work needs to do. If you do that, then you have no competition in that region of the parish.",

Montego Bay has excellent duty-free shopping, vibrant nightlife, and calm waters. Browse the local handicrafts at the open-air Harbour Street market, or the \"hip strip\" shops of Gloucester Avenue. The underwater crevices of Widowmaker’s Cave offer an intricate diving experience. Float serenely down the Martha Brae River on a bamboo raft and let your troubles melt away under the sun.",

She was so patient & skilled as she worked her magic! I’ve never seen my face or hair look that epic. I can’t do any of that type of work to that level on myself.

When I initially planned my wedding last year- my coordinator was Kimberly (and I do not know what she was doing/not sure if she knew either. Lol) then Natasha stepped in and FIXED EVERYTHING!! I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO THANK NATASHA ENOUGH FOR MAKING MY WEDDING DAY SMOOTH, SEAMLESS AND getting folks together (even when i left my phone (with my vows) in the room. The Doziers love you Natasha.  Next, when it came to making us as comfortable as possible, our Butlers -Devon, Renardo and Travis ALWAYS STEPPED UP WITH A SMILE!!!!  Anything I needed, they did their best to make it happen and our morning what's app messages made me smile everyday.  Karl- was swift, efficient and very welcoming as soon as we touched the resort. Finally,  due to an unfortunate situation,  we  met Basien yet he made sure that we were ok, he followed up on the situation and did his best to ensure that our wedding vacation was still happily celebrated.\n(I will write another review with specifics on what happened)..\nOverall...yup...I give 5 stars...my family and friends love staying at the Grand and Suites Resorts. My family and friends said they will go back next year to celebrate my 1 yr wedding anniversary\nEVEN IF I AM NOT THERE.. LOL.. Beautiful rooms. Beautiful scenery and Beautiful people... IBEROSTAR..BIG UP YASELF!!!",

Bob Marley's childhood home and mausoleum is in nearby Nine Mile. Jamaican history is on view at Seville Great House and at Columbus Park Museum.

We met many people that had been repeat guests at Jewel Paradise Cove and that’s got to say something! We highly recommend JPC. We want to specifically shout out to the entertainment staff that made our 9 days in Jamaica so fun! Dimario, Jhavol, Rasheeda & Britnee you guys were truly amazing and we had so much fun with you all. An extra special shout out to Dimario, for taking the time to get to know us and on your off time coming to teach us card games and becoming a friend. We truly felt like we were at home!",

They were touting Walnut sauce for the Ravioli but was never available in the Moonstone italian restaurant. When we asked for vegetables, they gave 1 broccoli and 2 pieces of carrots and they did not have the spiral pasta.\n6) In Jade Samurai at our table while others received several types of meats, for us (vegetarians) they just had vegetables and Rice with no Tofu as a protein option.\n7) Most of equipment in the Gym was dysfunctional.

I ordered the seafood boil. I asked the waitress if it was possible to do my meal without the jerk sausage. She said yes. I asked her again n she said sure. I further confirmed why I was making that request by saying \" I'm telling u this because I do not eat meat\".\nHad she told me this dish could not be prepared without sausage, I would have happily chosen something else but she told me it was OK.\n\nMy food arrived and I could only see the crabs and shrimps on top. I started to enjoy my meal only to get to a point where I bit into meat! I was so upset. Rather than apologising, her excuse is that the meal is prepared that way. My point is, if she knew it couldn't be done without meat, she should have said so! Her attitude and blatant disregard for violating my wishes, was nothing short of appalling. She was arguing and justifying her actions, saying I should have given her an explanation. I do not need to explain any reason why I don't eat meat. That's personal!\nFor personal health reasons I will not disclose on here why I do not eat meat. This could have been so much worse. Imagine if this was allergy related, this could have had a fatal impact by putting things in someone's meal that they cannot eat!\nI doubt she understands the gravity of what she has done. She said I didn't explain to her. what further explanation does \"I DON'T EAT MEAT\" require?\nThanks to my family and friends who jumped to my defense. I was shaking and so nauseous I ended up vomiting.\nI appreciate the supervisor who tried to offer something else and knock that meal off the bill. However I had no appetite at that point n would never trust them to make another meal. We didn't go there for free food. We went there with our money and expected to receive what we ordered.\nI'm yet to receive an apology from that waitress. Absolutely disgusting. \nSHARKIES TRAIN YOUR STAFF BETTER!! ",

                  "text": "We arrived on Sunday 12th and are still here at present. To be honest, we were mithered about the mixed reviews. We are well travelled and have stayed in many different types of accommodation around the world, so we came with an open mind. Firstly, the staff are friendly, accommodating and greet you all the time. We are in a garden cottage, and yes, it is dated, but its comfortable and clean. They are revamping a few of the cottages in the resort, which TUI never made us aware of building work taking place, but it hasnt mithered us much. The style of the garden cottages gives a traditional feel, set in well-kept gardens. The food has been basic but we've always had something different to fill up on. What people arriving need to bear in mind is that it is a 3 star resort. I think covid has had a huge impact in remploying staff when things have picked up again, but then which country hasn't had lasting effects economically off the back of it? If you want luxury, pay more money and stay elsewhere. Locals do come for a breaks too, but who doesn't travel to different parts of the UK for weekend breaks back home?! This is a resort to absolutely chill out at. If you like spending your time doing nothing then this is for you. Also, remember this is Jamaica. The people and the vibe are chilled!",

                  "text": "The Good\n\nMy husband and I spent 8 days in the Moon Palace—Jamaica and were incredibly impressed with the quality of the service, food, location, and aesthetics of the grounds. I was worried I’d be bored at a small resort, but between activities, tours, shows, bars, pools, meals and snacks, spa treatments (including hydrotherapy), and the beach, we were satiated with food and experience the entire time.\n\nI much prefer the Moon Palace—Cancun (and The Grand, by far), but Jamaica was still a great experience.\n\n___________\nSome of the exceptional employees we met included:\n\nRoshin in the Boulangerie was my man for the week. His smile is infectious and you can see he is loved by other employees and guests alike. He recognized me every time I came by and made me feel special just for showing up. I’m really going to miss my morning coffee, mid-morning pastries, afternoon ice cream, pre-dinner chocolates, and after-dinner cakes. Thank you, Roshin, for helping me love my vacation!\n\nAndre (Dive team) was so kind and helpful. I don’t think he was even on the clock when I stopped him and asked for help. He took his time with me to find out what I needed in terms of swim training and was able to provide me with great advice on where I could swim safely, on currents and locations, etc. \nwhen I returned the next day to talk to him about my swim, he gave me further advice on other routes. It would be even better for me. He. Is. Amazing!\n\nTony (gardener) was encouraging. He told me he was a distance swimmer who was concerned about my safety and showed me where I would be best suited for my morning swimming adventures. He even taught me some Jamaican and encouraged me to keep my heart healthy with coconut gel.\n\nDookie (Pier 8) greeted us with an amazing smile and was incredibly eager to ensure our meal was a fantastic experience for my husband and me. His smile and joy was contagious. \n\nNurse Lyn took excellent care of me when I was down. She was concerned about my overall health and injuries, giving me advice on how to heal and improve the long-term positive outcome for my injuries. She was very compassionate and respectful and didn’t even make fun of me for my stupid mistakes.\n\nThe Scuba Caribe Team took me on two tours: a sunset catamaran experience and 11:00 snorkeling tour. The staff was so responsible and lots of fun.\n\nObrian was my server in Buccaneers for lunch one day. When I asked for a real fruit smoothie, instead of going straight to the bar for one using pre-mixed fruit, he asked which fruits I preferred. He then went to the buffet, collected all my favorites, and asked the bartender to blend them. It was perfect! But, even more perfect was his willingness to whatever he could to help me keep to my diet and enjoy my food and dining service. What a great representative for Palace Resorts! \n\nFranz in the piano/martini bar was always so polite and accommodating. He quickly learned the types of drinks I like and eagerly shared new surprises every time I was ready for another round.\n\nSequoia Anderson was the representative who helped me book all my spa appointments and tours before my trip. She was so patient with me, kindly accommodating all my changes. We had a huge collection of activities we wanted to do and she spent weeks with me online ensuring we would have the perfect vacation.\nSequoia Anderson (sanderson@palaceresorts.com)\n\n—————\nThe Not-So-Good\n\nThere were lots of items not working in the spa. Just a few were several of the heated chairs (I was only able to sit in a heated one once), several of the fountains in the large pool (a problem because they are massage therapeutically), and, most surprising and disappointing, no hot water in the showers.\n\nHaving the pools closed at night was strange and a pain. Having them closed in the morning was a real problem because I wanted to use them to cool down from my ocean swims.\n\nOne day I wanted to go to Dunn’s River Falls so asked at the entryway the cost of a taxi for 1 person roundtrip. I was informed it was US$60. Instead, I had a delightful FREE under 3-mile walk, loved climbing the falls, and took a cab back for US$10 including tip. Palace management, please don’t let your cab drivers extort your guests.\n\nThe worst thing was the VIP beach chairs (and possibly all other pool and beach lounge chairs, but I didn’t use them). When guests are done using them, they often leave their towels on the chairs. Those towels then stay there all day so it’s unclear which chairs are taken and which were vacated hours ago. As a result, there are no clean chairs for anyone by the end of the day. One small way to combat this is to put towel return bins in the VIP area so guests would be more encouraged to clean up after themselves. Additionally, Some guests hog the chairs for the entire day. There were quite a few chairs in the VIP and pool areas that people covered with towels and cheap personal items that they left all day. The guests choose the best spots (shaded and near the action), but leave them vacant for hours a day so no one else can enjoy the experience. This happens despite the fact there are signs saying guests are not allowed to save seats. Perhaps employees could regularly place stickers on the chairs  that are abandoned and if they’re still there 30 minutes later, they could clear the chairs of towels and other items. Items could be stored in the towel exchange area until requested by the guest that rudely left them there in the first place. Though this would anger several guests who were being selfish, they would surely be less likely to do it again and there would be more guests who would likely be extremely grateful for the proaction.\n________________\nSome of the not-so-exceptional employees we met included:\n\nJohnoy—gym\nWhen I entered the gym on the evening I arrived, I met Johnoy who was sitting by the door. I asked him for a running map and he asked me why I would be asking him for a map. I asked him if he worked there and he confirmed that he did. When I explained to him that I was looking for a map that would show me where I can run long distances near the property, he eventually explained to me that he could not recommend anywhere to run other than the beach because he can only recommend things on property. This makes perfect sense, but I was very put back when he seemed so nonchalant when asking me why I might be asking him about a map in the first place. He was quieter offensive in the way he said it. Usually, employees in a gym are eager to help guests maintain their training goals while on vacation. \nNext, he told me that he wasn’t able to help me with any swimming questions. He directed me to the pier where I was unable to find anyone.\nI later took a spin class where he was the instructor. He did a good job at that. Perhaps he should stick with the training, avoiding the entryway.\n\nKrystal (gel removal and manicure): She was so unfriendly. She never greeted me and the only thing she said was to relax and put my feet up and down. I was so surprised when she rolled her eyes at me several times despite the fact that (I thought) I was really nice to her.",

The staff are so RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL!!\n\nWe walked in and there was such a long line because there was a family of like 30 people, okay I had to pay an extra $110 Canadian dollars (on top of what I already paid for their photo package)to get pictures of my baby and my family together at the excursion. \n\nWe wanted to do the Sting Ray activity and waited there for 40 minutes and not one person from the staff offered to allow us to do this. Just stared upon us and offered nothing but looks. \n\nOkay next we’re finally going to do our encounter which was 1.5 hours late, due to how busy they were. I’m Canadian Jamaican and the staff was all cussing each other in patois, about the load of people that booked the excursion at once. All their nasty attitudes really ruined the experience. The encounter itself was great as was the lady with her Dolphin I don’t remember the lovely ladies name. We had to rush the lunch that was included because of them being late to rush over to Dunns River Falls. The food was cold, dry and they didn’t offer you options nor a drink! Water is $5 !! This place is a complete money grab! \n\nNow upon leaving the establishment with my children, the staff at the gate were having extremely inappropriate conversations about going down on women and things of that nature. All in all I would never return to this establishment \n\nDo better my fellow Jamaican people.. do better! ",

We appreciated the shorter transfer from Montego Bay as compared to some of the other Sandals on the opposite side of the island. We were somewhat worried about the smaller size of this resort but were not disappointed at all. The staff at this resort (each and every staff member) that we encountered here was outstanding! But ESPECIALLY would like to recognize our concierge Stacie Ann. She went completely out of her way to ensure our stay was not only memorable but incredible. She actually stayed late past her scheduled shift to decorate our room in which we were celebrating our anniversary and my birthday. She is truly an amazing person with a heart of gold! The hotel manager Shawn had helped us through a few small bumps that we encountered while here and he did not disappoint!! And Rushell, our server at the jerk shack was sure that I had enough of my favorite Jamaican cuisine of the jerk chicken each and every day we visited with her. Our only issue with this resort is that they allow other guests to vape while at the pool. I had bought this to the attention of a few staff members that did not correct those guests. ",

They are lovely people and made the experience unforgettable. Thank you guys!\n\nWe ate our most memorable meals of our trip here, dining on the open-air balcony. Sharon and Sophia our cooks were amazing and delivered spectacular meals. Curried goat- the best I’ve ever had (my wife’s Jamaican and she told the ladies that they’ve wrecked things for her as their curried goat was soo good). Ackee and salt fish, grilled lobster, pepper pot soup, pumpkin rice, fried breadfruit, steamed fish, mackerel rundown, Jame’s cousin’s jerk pork were all incredible. They are on their game, anticipate your needs and surprise you with kindness at every turn.\n\nEveryone we ran across was sincerely welcoming and upbeat. This is a special place.",

Super fun photo wall to take souvenir photos of a celebration night out with friends, family or romantic night out. Food was fantastic and enjoyed the a la carte menu. Highly recommend! Shawn was especially welcoming and made it a memorable experience.",

The furniture has a musty smell.  The bedroom is even worse smelling.  There might be fresh sheets on the bed, but that's the ONLY fresh thing in that bedroom.  The makeup mirror in the bathroom is BROKEN.  With little effort, I could have had an amputated toe.  Does anyone ever check to see what might need replacement?  One of the faucets didn't turn on - at all!  The really amazing sight was the cheesecloth-thin towel with strings shredding off of them.  These are towels that become rags at my house.  I don't expect to find them at an upscale \"resort.\"",

His expertise on the wine was helpful. Staff is educated on the menu and is able to answer questions from growing to tasting. We went midweek, but were old that weekends can be very busy. There is a small gift shop with wine accessories for purchase. The winery is associated with and Inn and restaurant. Only service dogs are allowed. ",
