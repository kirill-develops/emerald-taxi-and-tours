On arrival you take a little boat like raft over to the main boat where you will eat your meal, this takes seconds. The food takes about twenty five minutes to get to the table but you are advsied about the wait time. The food was lovely we had the baked fish and the surf and turf and warm bananna cake for pudding. It is a delightful view we were seated outside the boat. The wait staff are very pleasant and very accommodating. Please be aware you may be bitten by the mosquito's they ate me alive but the staff have a repellant spray at hand. This is a lovely place to have dinner with beautiful views, we would definitely eat here again. ",

            "text": "Visited the houseboat grill with my partner & when I’m telling you from once we’ve arrived we were greeted by the ferry service personnel who accompanied us unto the boat. We were then seated by a hostess which was very polite of her. Melissha our server & Mario our bartender are very pleasant, understandable, even though melissha is NEW she has great customer service. She checked on us throughout the entire evening to ensure that we were great. On the other hand, Mario our bartender, serve us our drinks which was well mix & prepared. The food was awesome & you could taste the love in it. It was my partner’s birthday & they came out singing happy birthday along with a well plated candled lava cake. We then asked to speak with the manager (Olivia) to express our gratitude & satisfaction we experienced. She’s a good listener & pleasant individual, it was very nice meeting her. We loved this place & 100% recommend it. From the view down to the service is immaculate, will definitely return.",

Really cool getting the little ferry over to the boat.\n\nWe told the waitress we just wanted to have a drink not dinner. We were seated upstairs and told the bartender will be up soon. 10 minutes later he arrives (ok- we are getting used to island time no big deal.) we ordered two cocktails- nothing over complicated or time consuming to make one was an old fashioned. 20 minutes later STILL NO SIGN of our drinks!we agreed if it gets to 30 minutes we will walk out as this is ridiculous.\n\nMy husband went downstairs and seen the bartender was making the drinks. So we continued to wait. At this stage I didn’t even want it as the whole point was a quick drink before we go back to our hotel. After37 minutes we got our drinks. Asked for the bill and it was another 15. \n\nAfter reading some of the other reviews I’m glad we didn’t book here for food and the slow service of the drinks has totally put me off. It’s a shame.",

It’s nice to be able to watch them smoking the pork over wood. If you’re staying nearby, I might get food to go instead of eating here. \nWhile the food was good, there were lots of flies at the tables and smoke was heavy at times. \nCheap red stripe, good plantains, and of course good pork.",

Got there and sat down, took about 20 mins for drinks to arrive (plus they ran out of souvenir cups so I made my mind up for 1 drink as it’s ridiculous prices) - I ordered fish tacos which were beautiful. Kept getting asked to get a picture but I knew they charged and didn’t want to have to pay. Music was country songs which was brilliant but the DJ would not stop talking - bearing in mind it was 1pm not 1am. Came to $11,250 (Jamaican dollars) - gave the waitress $12,000 expecting my change I was going to tip maybe $1,000. Lo and behold the waitress never brought me my money back at all which is so wrong in any country. So that ruined my mood. Then I was actually surprised there was no beach and only 4/5 Sun loungers down some dodgy stairs looking into the water. The slide is a serious hazard so I stayed away from it. Also from the pictures - a bunch of the water ‘obstacle course’ was missing. \nSad to say I was incredibly disappointed and was hoping to go back multiple times and make use of the free shuttle there from the hotel. That won’t be the case - from what I’ve seen go to the other ones in Jamaica! ",

Within 5 minutes of arrival we were pounced on by an over zealous cameraman demanding all manner of poses. He then wanted $25 for photos and wouldn't take no for an answer. The Jamaicans have several polite ways of telling folks to go away but in this case the old familiar two worded suggestion was required.\nThen a clown on stilts wanted money as he thought we had taken his picture....as if. The drinks, food and shop are heavily overpriced and service stops when a boat trip moors up.It is the only Margaritaville where they don't play Jimmy Buffett music \nWhen presented with my bill I was instructed to choose 20, 25, or 30%  as a tip . Considering the poor service I refused. We were then told by the server that she wasn't paid and worked for tips.\nI suggested that she have  meeting with her boss who is one of the richest blokes in the US and has recently been classified as a billionaire \n\n",

In fact, we had breakfast, lunch and dinner there because we were staying at the Associated bed and breakfast, Polkerris. The combination of the two made our stay memorable. We went to supposedly “better” restaurants in other areas, but we never had a better meal. The traditional Jamaican dishes are awesome. But the other dishes are also amazing including the sweet and sour chicken and shrimp. We rated most of the menu and ended our evenings with the milkshakes (epic) or the decadent coconut cream pie. All truly amazing!!!! I love this place. Thank you to the proprietors for making our stay in Jamaica so amazing. ",

Then out of nowhere my little niece said \"something smells dead\" and made a gagging sound. The jerk chicken smelled like a decaying 🐕. it's been a few hours and the smell is still lingering with us. How does one serve spoiled chicken and had the decency to give us a poor a** excuse that you don't know how it happened. How many ppl ate the jerk chicken that day.  My advice when eating out be cautious and smell your food. Inspect it. Cuz these restaurants out here trying to ☠️ us.",

            "text": "We hired Mystic Thai to cater our wedding after visiting the restaurant a number of times in the past. The service at the restaurant is fantastic and the food is some of the best Indian food I have ever tasted, it has the perfect balance of flavors and the very fresh ingredients. Since we had a great experience at the restaurant, we asked if they would be able to cater our wedding for 150 people about 90 minutes away from their restaurant. The catering request was a little complex because we had to feed our guests for three full days. Mystic Thia absolutely NAILED IT! Every one of the guests raved about the food. The presentation was perfect, it was one time, and any adjustments we needed were easily accommodated. \n\nIt was also a great pleasure working with Karina. She is on top of everything with the team and helped make the event successful. She was even able to make some atypical traditional dishes that are not normally served at weddings. We gave her a recipe and they were able to turn it from a dish that serves 4-6 into a much larger production for all the wedding guests. I have worked in hospitality for over 10 years and Karina and her team provided some of the best food and service I have ever experienced. We went to many different places to find the perfect caterer and none of them compared to Mystic Thai.  My wife and I are super grateful that we could work with her for the wedding. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for the best food and service in Jamaica. ",

            "text": "Our friends and family group of 6 enjoyed a wonderful dining experience at Mystic Thai. It's a lovely setting, with comfortable lighting and tables big enough for our group of 6 to be comfortable. Their menu is robust, with both Thai and Indian selections. So many choices! Our group started with drinks (my mango and Prosecco was delicious!) and ordered  7 appetizers because we could not make up our minds, and every one of them was yummy and very well-portioned for sharing. Don't miss the fried corn--we ordered another round, it was so yummy! And the celery and chicken dumplings (5 to an order) were juicy and moist. The crispy lamb was a hit with our lamb lovers, uniquely flavored and just a tad spicy. (spice can be adjusted to taste when ordering). Entrees were also excellent--well spiced, plentiful portions, and so nicely presented!  We shared 4 entrees, including shrimp pad Thai,  red Thai curry, pepper chicken and pork belly--and we ordered a few breads (naan) from the Indian menu. The naan alone is worth another visit--it was hot, fresh and so tasty. The owner, Karina, stopped by our table to make sure we were happy--a very nice touch. She is opening another restaurant in Kingston and we look forward to checking it out. It was a  WONDERFUL meal and we will make this a regular restaurant to visit when we're visiting Mo Bay.",

The 4 people behind us from the same resort had a reservation, again they had no record of it.  They tried to seat us in a small closed in room with no view and was hot.  We said no. We finally got seated in a nice spot by the water.  \n\nThe service was slow and the food just okay.   The menu was covered with lobster options.  When we all went to order lobster, there is no lobster available, because lobster season is August-September.  They should indicate that on the menu. \n\nAlso the 4 people that I mentioned earlier got seated, waited a long while and got up and left.  \n\nWould not recommend this restaurant.  Not to mention the taxi driver who the same tour guide lined up,  tried to charge us $120 for a 10 minute drive each way for six people.  \n\nVery disappointing night. Would not recommend.",

We had mixologists Veronica, Karina, and Jason on-site to lead our small class, and I can honestly say that these three individuals are top-tier in their profession. Not only were they knowledgeable in the extensive background of the Jimmy Buffet legacy and business, but their welcoming, humorous, and positive demeanor made all the difference to turning this class into an unforgettable experience. I hope and wish that anyone visiting this location ask for Veronica, Karina, and/or Jason for service, because these individuals will not disappoint! Thank you, Jimmy Buffet’s Margaritaville Negril, for providing CSA these skilled and personable professionals to teach our Margaritaville Mixology class!!!",

Over 90 minutes for a cheeseburger in hell. A lady in the corner was selling fake Cuban cigars and all types of drugs. While we waited on our taxi an employee snapped our photo. About 10 minutes later two teenagers on a motorcycle came up to jump us. I suspect they got the picture of us from the employee.

The ambience, the setting and the various sets were absolutely captivating. They gave us sexy, they gave sassy and they gave us spicy. Muy Caliente to be precise! We thoroughly enjoyed the experience....especially me. Our waitress was excellent and though the night was very busy we were made to feel like the only persons there. It's an oasis in a sea of entertainment options that you won't regret choosing.\n\nI would recommend this as a stop whenever you are in Montego Bay. Coral Cliff is an entertainment hub with something for everyone all day and night.\n\nEXCELLENT!",

He told the person that he only sleeps with white men. He never attempted to do caddy work. He was either on his phone or talking with his friends on the course. \nSeveral times I told him that I know he wouldn’t behave in the manner he did if were not for the fact that I was a black woman. He didn’t even want to put the golf ball on the t for me  when I asked because I had tweaked my back. At one point he left his job which was to be of help to me and went off to go and speak with his friend. I drove off in the golf cart. He gave away my balls and he had the nerve to have an attitude and ask me for a tip. In fact he and his friend came to my car and asked me for a tip. After what was by far and away the worst golf experience I had ever had. \nI am a very busy woman and so I didn’t have time to review this establishment until now. But if you are a woman of color traveling solo. I would not recommend it. I was there on January 4 2023. I can’t remember his name but I assure you. He is not a good caddy.",

Mike and Al were our caddies and these guys were absolute beauties!  Their helpful insights and ability to read greens made our round so much more enjoyable.  The course is a mix of ocean view holes and mountain holes with lush jungle everywhere.  The ancient relics from the old sugar refinery give the course real character.  The Callaway rentals were fine and the course conditions were good.  The greens were very fast with subtle breaks that made them challenging yet fun.  I would highly recommend playing here if you have the opportunity!",

            "text": "I took a 2 hour lesson with Kevyn at Half Moon Golf Club and it was worth every penny. What a great experience Kevyn evaluated my swing and identified the glaring problems (weak grip, outside take away, steep swing path, swaying lower body) and we worked on drills I could do anywhere to help correct the bad habits. We finished the lesson with a 5-minute video where I recorded Kevyn demonstrating the drills, we worked on worked on and detailing how to structure a practice session at the range. I started the lesson at 10AM and it was HOT if your sensitive to heat make sure to drink a lot of water the day before and the day of the lesson. \n\nMy biggest problem going into the lesson was slicing off the tee and I played 9 holes 2 days after my lesson with Kevyn, I was hitting my 3w dead straight off the tee to the point that the caddie said “man you’re really crushing that club”. It made me laugh and I responded you should have seen me before the lesson. I highly recommend stopping in for a lesson if you’re in Montego Bay the course and staff are incredible and Kevyn is a fantastic teacher.",

He was tons of fun, engaging and explained all of the logic behind the swing. The lesson went so well I went back for two more - he completely transformed my swing (see before and after photos)! If you want dramatic results in a very short time period there is no one better! \n\nIn our last lesson we went out on the course and it's beautiful and extremely well maintained. The staff are also really friendly and helpful. \n\nI've recommended Kevyn and the course to several friends who traveled to Jamaica in April and I'm already planning my trip back ! Must do in Jamaica and beyond highly recommend!",

The attention to detail and time that he gave me whilst I was lucky enough to be in Jamaica for 5-weeks was outstanding.    The course, itself, was very forgiving, as long as you hit the right shot and did not go off line!   I would absolutely recommend the resort for not only couples that are looking to get away to play golf, but it is a definitely a must-do if 'the lads' are visiting Jamaica on a golf-trip.",

            "text": "This place is beautiful location and private  but the roof leaked in my bedroom everyday it rained. I reported and they stated it's being repaired. Not sure what happen after we left. The white sofa outside needs replacing its peeling and tattered and old. The inside staff is excellent, the chef is a thief and will purchase on your bill so check it before paying if he shops for you. He drinks and smoke on the job and tried to save grocery and skimpy on food served that we purchased to keep on last day. I reported but not sure what happen. The butler was super accommodating stayed up w the house and the maid service was awesome. Mr Andre and  Ms Audrey I wish I could've brought back home with me super kind so sweet . One golf cart was down always so we had to wait for a ride to go back and forth. With the roof and couch and chef adjustments this would be a 10 star instead of 8.5. The staff gets a  10 star well the chef 7 star. I was annoyed with his attitude and demeanor. He wasn't friendly like the rest of staff it was like he was forced to be there or something. I will definitely recommend to friends, but I will tell them not to have high expectations with the outdoor furniture set and a chef.\nThe place was clean, warm and inviting with a few minor changes. This place will be a home away from home in my option. I hope they repair the roof and replace white crappy couch outdoor. Chef just gotta do better cooking wise and creativity, flavor and his demeanor and appearance. He walked around in a dirty white T-shirt, which was pretty disgusting to me, while everybody else was in a uniform.\nOverall awesome space, a few updates it would be perfect but the owners must invest in updating every 7 years as needed. While I was, there are seven years ago, I was in awe, this reunion I was a little sad, but overall had a great time.\n",

         "description": "The greatest of Jamaican great houses, the Rose Hall Great House has a story with all the elements of an engaging novel. Built in 1770 by John Palmer and his wife, it eventually became the residence of their grandnephew, John Rose Palmer. In 1820, Palmer married Annee, a beautiful but feisty English girl. Little did John know that his young wife possessed “black magic” powers that would eventually lead to his demise. During her reign as mistress of the plantation, Annee did away with two more husbands and countless lovers. “The White Witch of Rose Hall” has fascinated generations, and even today, there are those who claim to see Annee passing through the Great House. A candle-lit evening tour of the Rose Hall Great House is a must for visitors to Montego Bay. Your guided exploration of the former home of Jamaica’s White Witch, Annee Palmer, includes captivating and chilling stories of love, murder and mystery skillfully told by knowledgeable guides. You’re sure to feel goose bumps as these eerie tales come to life in this grand estate, where ghost sightings have been reported over the years. Tours also give historic insight into this grandest of Jamaican great houses, now beautifully restored with 18th-century decor and antiques. To conclude this fascinating adventure, you can visit the dungeon, now transformed into a tavern called Annee’s Pub. Many visitors find that the famous rum cocktail, known as “Witches Brew” helps banish the spirits of ghosts or black magic they sense still lingering in the mansion.",

It was a magical experience and a must see with the naked eyes.  The waters were warm and calm.  It was certainly amazing to see the bioluminescent creatures come alive once the waters were activated.  A truly spectacular moment to see!  It was cool to know the water level was only 4 feet deep.  Our Boat Captain Eric was very nice and allowed us time to take it all in.  Many thanks to the team and Craig for coordinating this wonderful experience for my Husband and myself!",

After completion of the rafting we were bused to \"Main Street\" which we thought was Falmouth but in fact was a sketchy shopping centre half an hour drive away. Total waste of time. We were looking for some local experience, not the usual tourist traps, but this did not work out as expected. If you want to have a real local experience you will have to go on your own.",

Sadly I can’t recall the guys name but he was hilarious throughout but also managed to give us the facts in a fun way. The tour lasts around 45 minutes but it’s just a few caves and a small underground lake. Some of the cave passages have low roofs (I am over 6 ft tall) and underfoot is uneven - just as you would expect.",

This is actually less safe than just a couple going up together and after about 50 feet everyone realizes it. Following the guide is not a bad idea because they will have you do some fun things…and take pictures too that you can purchase later. We went with a group and a couple of is had waterproof cell holders which was great because you can go and get pictures of your own how you like. \nDon’t forget water shoes and a waterproof cell phone holder. With the amount of people even on a non-cruise day in April it almost seemed like an attraction in an awesome amusement park. They say the dark rocks are slippery but there wasn’t a lot of them and I didn’t see anyone having problems.",

Quick and straightforward no hanging about then our Falls guide Patrick bigfoot arrived with Craig who filmed our climb. My knees aren't that good in the UK damp weather so I was a little worried if they were big steps I would be able to do it. I told Patrick and he took me by the hand and pulled me up with a push from behind from my fella. We made it. We had a few photo stops on the way up and the guide made it fun. Probably about 20 of us in our group. Seemed to go really quick and although we were told it wasn't that busy I thought it was. Well worth a visit and special thanks to Patrick for getting us up there. There are a couple of escape routes if you can't make it all the way or if you dont want to get wet you can walk a path to the side. The beach is beautiful and the trees and surroundings. We worn water shoes not water socks well worth it only slipped once which was my fault as I didnt step where my guide stepped. There are lockers and changing places toilets. We left our stuff on the mini bus. We took a waterproof camera and people took their phones in waterproof plastic pouches around their necks. Also to tip your guide they will come back to the car park or you could use your waterproof pouch.",

The natural mineral water in the spring is 35 feet deep; However, the edges of the spring are shallow for guests to stand or sit down. Thrill seekers and staff entertain guests with dives only a daredevil can perform. Some guests jump into the spring, others choose to climb in using a safe iron ladder. Naturally occurring minerals in Blue Hole Mineral Spring are recognized for their therapeutic value. Guests often enjoy a Blue Hole Mineral massage where staff will purify, exfoliate, and soften your skin. Reviewers sure seem to be pleased with the results.",

Roads are narrow and bumpy so make sure you have a good driver. \n\nWhen we arrived we were pleasantly greeted and paid our entrance fee ($20 US per person) to swim. You can go in both the Hole and in the swimming pool, which both contain the same mineral water. \n\nI’m 62 and was nervous about going down the steps (and coming back up), but was reassured it was safe and a guide came with me both ways. The females all got a limestone scrub while enjoying the cool mineral waters. \n\nSomething fun to do on a hot day!",

The staff was very genuine and honest, really good people. You get an unofficial guide for your experience. We had Geddy who was absolutely amazing. We gave him our phone and he managed to swim all around in the water taking multiple pictures of us and somehow never got our phone wet. There was another guy named Tonto who very awesome as well. They are not pushy for a tip, so make sure you tip them well. They also have a locker room, but it wasn’t needed as the staff we encountered were very honest and attentive. They also have a pool and rooms you can rent as well as a bar. These were some of the best people we met while visiting this beautiful country!",
